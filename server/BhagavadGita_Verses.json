    "commentary": "War is nothing new to this world. Thousands of years\nago wars were being fought, such as the one at Kurukßetra,\nto resolve the differences between good and evil and for\nthe purpose of material gain. From ancient times to our\nmodern era, practically not a day on this Earth has passed\nwhen someone, somewhere, was not fighting over some-\nthing. Throughout history men have gathered on the field\nof battle to fulfil their greed for wealth and glory, some-\ntimes nobly, but more often ignobly. The same is happen-\ning in the 21st Century. War it seems is an unavoidable\nkarmic destiny of human civilisation.\nChapter 1\n7\nPeace, on the other hand, is rather elusive. Peace is\ntalked about and even prayed for, but seldom makes more\nthan a momentary appearance. Most of our lives, even for\nthe humblest of souls, are spent struggling for existence\neither socially, politically, financially, mentally or physi-\ncally. For most of us the temporary absence of any major\ncrisis is what we would call peace. However, peace (or çånti\nas it is known amongst yogîs) is a state of consciousness\nand not a condition relative to the external affairs of the\nmaterial world. Peace is an internal experience.\nThe wisdom of the Vedic literature, Çrîmad Bhågavatam\nsays, jîvo-jîvasya-jîvanaµ – one living being is food for\nanother living being. From the minutest forms of life\nto the most complex, one life is sustained by the loss of\nanother. Thus, the basic principle for material existence is\nfundamentally flawed with violence. Peace then, for most\nof us, comes in doing what we have to do and believing\nthat we have done the right thing. Therein lies the fine line\nbetween war and peace. Is what we think to be good, or\nwhat we are conditioned to believe, actually right?\nThe ability to discriminate between right and wrong, or\nin some cases good and evil, largely depends on the extent\nof knowledge from which we draw our conclusions. A poor\nfund of knowledge naturally results in faulty conclusions.\nTherefore, it is in our best interest to seek out the greatest\nsource of knowledge – knowledge of the Absolute Truth,\nand familiarise ourselves with that.\nBhagavad-gîtå is perhaps the most widely read book\nof theistic knowledge in the world. Whatever knowledge\none finds in similar books such as the Dhammapada, the\nBible, the Torah, the Koran etc. is also found in the Bhaga-\nBhagavad-gita\n8\nvad-gîtå. But in the Bhagavad-gîtå one will find knowl-\nedge that is not present anywhere else. Consequently, the\nBhagavad-gîtå surpasses all branches of knowledge. What\nlies ahead in these commentaries is a look into the vastness\nof the knowledge of the Absolute Truth contained in the\nBhagavad-gîtå."

    "commentary": "At the outset of the Kurukßetra war, Duryodhana\nmade the classic military blunder of underestimating the\nstrength of his adversary. Possibly blinded by his greed for\nthe kingdom or by his longstanding hatred for his cousins,\nthe På√∂avas, he entered the engagement thinking that his\nenemy’s strength was limited.\nHate and greed are certainly poor allies of judgment,\nusually resulting in wrong decisions and the senseless loss\nof life. No better examples in modern times need be cited\nthan that of the wars in Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan\nChapter 1\n11\nwherein underestimating the will of a people has led to the\nloss of millions of innocent lives.\nThe classic commentators on Bhagavad-gîtå have all\npointed out the blunder of Duryodhana at Kurukßetra.\nParticularly it has been mentioned that Duryodhana failed\nto recognise that when Çrî K®ß√a, the Supreme Person,\nwas there to advise Arjuna, that Arjuna would be a most\nformidable opponent.\nHistory has shown us that wars are fought out of greed,\nhatred or religious prejudice. It is simply a convenience to\nthink that, ‘God is on our side.’ The idea that ‘God is on\nour side’ is certainly a comforting thought and has accom-\npanied men into almost every war that we know of since\nthe rise of Abrahamic religions. However, the problem has\nalways been that in all these conflicts both sides assumed\nthe banner of righteousness, declaring, ‘God wills it!’ This\nis sometimes called the ‘theology of convenience’.\nEven today it makes good to stir up the troops or rally\nthe suicide bombers to their deaths by declaring that,\n“God favours our cause.” It is a fact that during these\ndark periods of history, more people have died, and more\ninnocent people put to death in the name of God, than\nby any other single unnatural cause. Many people con-\nsider despotic political regimes as the ultimate empires\nof cruelty, but the truth is that religious fanaticism has\nbrought far more unnecessary death to the world than any\npolitical system of government.\nSo what makes the war at Kurukßetra any different\nthan modern wars fought for greed or between religious\nfanatics? Is it not simply jingoism to say that because Çrî\nK®ß√a, the Supreme Person, was on the side of the På√∂a-\nBhagavad-gita\n12\nvas that they were correct in destroying their enemies?\nThe difference is that Kurukßetra was not fought because\none side had a different religious ideology than the other.\nKurukßetra was a fratricidal war – a family feud brought\non by human faults: greed for sovereignty, failure in duty,\nenvy, family attachment and falsely identifying the body\nas the self.\nBut unlike any other war in history, Kurukßetra would\nrecord a profound lesson for the benefit of all future gen-\nerations. The lesson was taught by Çrî K®ß√a in the form\nof Bhagavad-gîtå – a lesson that would enable humanity to\novercome its mundane shortcomings, become established\nin transcendence and attain self-realisation."

But upon seeing the enemy before him, Arjuna was\nshocked and fell into a state of bewilderment.\nNow the stage at Kurukßetra was set, so that Çrî K®ß√a\ncould speak Bhagavad-gîtå – Arjuna became overwhelmed\nwith grief and gave up his duty. As a warrior Arjuna was\nduty-bound to fight, but seeing the ordeal that lay ahead\nhe could not proceed.\nThe world is certainly full of faults, dangers, unfortu-\nnate events, cruel and hateful designs to exploit others and\na host of other qualities that one would certainly describe\nas evil. To quote Edmund Burke, the Irish statesman and\nBhagavad-gita\n16\nphilosopher, “The only thing necessary for evil to triumph\nis for good men to stand by and do nothing.”\nArjuna had resolved in his mind not to fight, knowing\nthat the destruction of the dynasty meant the loss of tradi-\ntion, the onslaught of degradation, the birth of unwanted\nchildren etc. and thus evil would be the only outcome.\nArjuna also understood deep within himself that to do\nnothing also assured grim repercussions."

As H®ßîkeça, K®ß√a\nis the Master of the mind and senses  – thus He is never\nbewildered or put into illusion. As Acyuta, He is incapa-\nble of making mistakes or wrong decisions. Arjuna needed\nK®ß√a’s advice urgently – advice that he could depend on,\nthat would give relief to his disturbed mind and senses.\nAs Keçava, K®ß√a is the killer of the demon Keçî who\nrepresents the false sense of greatness. Çrî K®ß√a is known\nto have killed numerous demons during His advent and\neach of those demons represented negative qualities that\nhinder one’s progress in spiritual life such as the desire for\nname and fame, dishonesty, false pride, deceitfulness, cru-\nelty, foolishness, violence, lust, anger, greed, false teachings\nand bad habits etc. Arjuna was confident that by taking\nshelter of Çrî K®ß√a, all that was an impediment to his sit-\nuation would be removed.\nChapter 1\n23\nBy addressing K®ß√a as the descendant of the V®ß√i\nDynasty, Arjuna was also reminding K®ß√a of the impor-\ntance of family traditions and to destroy them was Arjuna’s\nbiggest dilemma.\nॐ तिदित ीमहाभारते शतसाहां संिहतायां\nवैयािसां भीपवािण ीमगवीतासूपिनष\nिवायां योगशाे ीकाजनसंवादे\nसैदशनं नाम थमोऽायः ॥\noµ tat saditi çrî-mahåbhårate-çata-såhasryåµ saµhitåyåµ\nvaiyåsikyåµ bhîßma-parvå√i\nçrîmad bhagavad-gîtåsüpanißatsu\nbrahma-vidyåyåµ yoga-çåstre çrî k®ß√årjuna-saµvåde\nsainya-darçanaµ nåma prathamo’dhyåya˙\nOÂ TAT SAT – Thus ends Chapter One entitled\nSainya-Darçana from the conversation between Çrî\nK®ß√a and Arjuna in the Upanißad known as Çrîmad\nBhagavad-gîtå, the yoga-çåstra of divine knowledge,\nfrom the Bhîßma-parva of Mahåbhårata, the literature\nrevealed by Vyåsa in one hundred thousand verses.\nChapter 2\n27"

Here for\nthe first time in Bhagavad-gîtå, Çrî K®ß√a is addressed as\nBhagavån. According to Vedic scholars such as Paråçara\nMuni, Bhagavån means one who possesses all wealth,\nstrength, fame, beauty, knowledge and renunciation.\naiçvaryasya samagrasya vîryasya yaçasa˙ çriya˙\njñåna vairågyayos caiva ßa√√åµ bhaga itîra√å\nHe that possesses the attributes of sovereignty,\npotency, fame, wealth, knowledge and renunciation\nin full, is known as Bhagavån. (Viß√u Purå√a 6.5.74)\nAdditionally, Jîva Gosvåmî, the 16th Century Vaiß√ava\nphilosopher, says that Bhagavån is bhajanîya gu√a ca\nananta ca nitya˙ – He that possesses all adorable qualities\nand whose all-attractive nature is such that He attracts our\nfeelings of affection and adoration.\nIn contemporary society there is much debate as to\nwhether God exists or not. First it is necessary to define\nwhat we mean by ‘God’ before His existence can be deter-\nmined or dismissed. Accordingly, seers of the truth in\nancient India have concluded that if there is a God, then\nGod must necessarily be the owner and proprietor of\neverything; He must be all-powerful, the most famous, the\nmost beautiful, the possessor of all knowledge and at the\nsame time, detached or renounced. After careful analysis,\nthose seers of truth concluded that only Çrî K®ß√a could\nbe and is the ultimate fountainhead of Reality, the Abso-\nChapter 2\n31\nlute Truth. These findings have been corroborated by many\nsages throughout the ages (from before 10,000 BCE) and\nare dealt with extensively in the Vedic literatures such as\nthe Vedas, Upanißads, Purå√as, Råmåya√a, Mahåbhårata,\nVedånta-sütra, Çrîmad Bhågavatam and Brahma-saµhitå etc.\nîçvara˙ parama˙ k®ß√a˙ sac-cid-ånanda vigraha˙\nanådir ådir govinda˙ sarva-kåra√a-kåra√aµ\nK®ß√a is the Supreme Controller. His form is made\nof bliss, knowledge and eternity. He is the origin of\nall. He is the Master of the cows and the senses. He\nhas no other origin and He is the primeval cause of\nall causes. (Brahma-saµhitå 5.1)\nete cåµça kalå˙ puµsa˙ k®ß√as tu bhagavån svayam\nindråri vyåkulaµ lokaµ m®∂ayanti yuge yuge\nThe various avatåras are either plenary expansions\nor parts of plenary expansions. But K®ß√a is the orig-\ninal source of all avatåras. When impious elements\ndisturb His devotees, He manifests age after age in\norder to protect them. (Çrîmad Bhågavatam 1.3.28)\nharir eva sadårådhya˙ sarva-deveçvareçvara˙\nitare brahma-rudrådyå nava-jñeyå˙ kadåcana\nOnly Çrî Hari (K®ß√a) should be worshipped as the\nMaster of the entire universe. Brahmå, Çiva and all\nother demigods never violate this principle at any\ntime. (Padma Purå√a)\n32\nBhagavad-gita\nyatråvatîr√aµ k®ß√åkhyaµ\nparaµ brahmå naråk®tim\nWhen the Supreme Person descends in His human-\nlike form, He is K®ß√a, the Supreme Brahman.\n(Viß√u Purå√a 4.11.2)\ntasmåt k®ß√a eva paro devas taµ dhyåyet\ntaµ raset taµ bhajet taµ yajet\nThus K®ß√a is the Supreme Person. One should\nmeditate on Him. One should delight in Him. One\nshould worship Him and make offerings to Him.\n(Gopåla-tåpanî Upanißad 1.54)\nk®ßir bhü-våcaka˙ çabdo √aç ca nirv®ti-våcaka˙\ntayor aikyaµ paraµ brahma k®ß√a ityabhidhîyate\nThe verbal root k®ß refers to the all-attractive quality\nof K®ß√a, and the syllable √a refers to His spiritual\nbliss. When k®ß is added to the affix √a, it becomes\nthe word K®ß√a, indicating the Supreme Truth.\n(Mahåbhårata, Udyoga-parva 71.4)\nArjuna has become overwhelmed with compassion for\nthose who are about to die on the battlefield. In fact, such\nis his grief that he himself is prepared to die rather than\nkill his enemies. But Arjuna is a warrior and from a noble\nfamily, therefore K®ß√a advises Arjuna against his weakness\nof heart. If one is a warrior it is one’s duty to face the enemy\nand not cower away. Fighting is indeed a nasty business,\nbut when duty calls, such fighting may be unavoidable. In\nancient times, acts of aggression were abhorred and strictly\nChapter 2\n33\nforbidden in society and between nations. When such\naggression did occur, retaliation and war were acceptable.\nAccording to the great sage Vasiß†ha, there are six types of\naggressors and according to Manu-saµhitå these aggressors\nare to be met with lethal response.\nagnido garadaç caiva çastra-på√ir dhanåpaha˙\nkßetra-dåråpahårî ca ßa∂ ete hyåtatåyina˙\nThe arsonist who sets fire to one’s house, one who\nadministers poison, one who attacks with deadly\nweapons, one who usurps a nations resources, one\nwho invades and occupies a sovereign country and\none who kidnaps one’s family members - all should\nbe considered as aggressors. (Vasiß†ha-sm®ti 3.19)\nåtatåyinam åyåntaµ hanyåd evåvicårayan\nnåtatåyi-vadhe doßo hantur bhavati kaçcana\nWithout hesitation a warrior should destroy aggres-\nsors, as there is no bad reaction in slaying them.\n(Manu-saµhitå 8.350)\nThese verses are according to the rules given in the laws\nof society (artha-çåstra). Yet the laws of dharma (dhar-\nma-çåstra), which are superior to the artha-çåstra, state\nthat one should never inflict harm on any living being (må\nhiµsyåt sarva-bhütåni) – what to say of one’s family mem-\nbers and superiors?\nThis was Arjuna’s dilemma. Being a softhearted devo-\ntee of Çrî K®ß√a, Arjuna was disinclined to take up arms\nagainst his family members, but being a warrior he had\nto face his destiny. In this state of bewilderment, Arjuna\n34\nBhagavad-gita\ndecided to put aside his casual relationship with K®ß√a as a\nfriend and accept Çrî K®ß√a as his guru (spiritual master).\nThus K®ß√a accepted Arjuna as a disciple.\nAccording to Vedic knowledge there are numerous\nplanets and parallel universes wherein life can be found.\nSome of these planets and universes have higher standards\nof living than we experience on Earth and some are lower.\nIf one performs one’s prescribed duties in this life then\naccordingly, one is elevated to higher planets. However, if\none neglects his duty then only infamy and descending to\nlower planets awaits one in the next life.\nK®ß√a has used the word anårya meaning ‘non-åryan’\nto describe Arjuna’s disinclination to follow his prescribed\nVedic duties. For centuries there has been much contro-\nversy about who is an åryan and where the åryans came\nfrom. For the most part, all such considerations have been\nbased upon bodily designations in order to establish one\nrace of people as superior to another. But in Bhagavad-gîtå,\naccording to the words of Çrî K®ß√a, the åryans are those\nwho carry out their duties in accordance with the Vedic\ninjunctions. Thus it is understood that the word åryan\ndoes not pertain to a particular race of people, but to a\nconception of life and a way of living.\nKnowledge of the eternal existence of the infinite con-\nsciousness (K®ß√a) and the finite individual unit of con-\nsciousness (åtmå or the self) is the key to all Vedic wisdom.\nThis will be the central theme of K®ß√a’s instruction to\nArjuna in this chapter.\nChapter 2\n35"

Heat and cold, happiness and distress, pleasure\nand pain, birth and death – these are the perceptions of life\nexperienced by those with no knowledge of consciousness.\nBut those who are liberated from the bodily concept of life\nare awake in the conscious world and are always in balance,\neven in the face of opposing and contradictory situations\nin the material world.

Since the time of Darwin, and\neven amongst some philosophers of ancient India such as\n40\nBhagavad-gita\nCårvåka up to the present day, there are those who think\nthat life arises out of matter. The Big Bang Theory and\nother contemporary scientific ideas also support this\nopinion. However, the problem with such thinking is that\nthere is no concrete evidence whatsoever to explain or\ndemonstrate how lifeless matter ever developed the symp-\ntoms of life. The Theory of Evolution, as the Darwinians\nunderstand it, is substantially defeated in the fossil record,\nsince no ‘transitional species,’ that are supposed to reveal\nthe gradual evolution of living organisms from primitive\nspecies to advanced life forms, have ever been discovered.\nFurthermore, there is no suitable model to explain where\nmatter originated.\nThe numerous theories, new and ancient, that expound\nthat life arose from matter are fundamentally flawed in\nmany ways. On the other hand, from observing micro-\nscopic living creatures to giant creatures like the elephant\nand whale, it is self-evident that life comes from life. Thus,\nthe Vedic perspective on life is that all life comes from an\nintelligent life source, Çrî K®ß√a.\nScientific interest in finding the cause of the universe,\nand indeed to all life, is certainly laudable. Yet when all\nreasonable and honest research leads us to the conclusion\nthat life/consciousness is not a byproduct of matter and\nthe blueprint of intelligent design can be observed every-\nwhere and in all things, then it should also be intelligently\nconcluded that Super Consciousness is the cause of matter,\nthe universe and all living things."

The effects of\ntime on the material body are perceived as growth, main-\ntenance, by-products, old age, dwindling and death. But\nconsciousness, being transcendental to matter, transcends\ntime and therefore never grows old, dwindles or dies.\nIn certain religious traditions the Creator is sometimes\nvisualised as being an old man in the sky.

    "commentary": "The individual unit of consciousness is difficult to\nunderstand because it is transcendental, a non-material sub-\nstance, and cannot be seen with the material senses or even\nwith the world’s most powerful microscope. It is atomic\nin size and can only be perceived through perfect intelli-\ngence. This atomic unit of consciousness is situated in the\nmidst of the five kinds of subtle life-airs within the body\n(prå√a, apåna, vyåna, samåna, udåna). It is located within\nthe heart and spreads its influence throughout the body.\nTo give us some idea of the minuteness of the åtmå and its\npositioning within the body, the Çvetåçvatara Upanißad and\nMu√∂aka Upanißad provide the following information:\nbålågra-çata bhågasya çatadhå kalpitasya ca\nbhågo jîva˙ sa vijñeya˙ sa cånantyåya kalpate\nWhen the upper part of a hair is divided into one\nhundred parts and again each of those parts is fur-\nther divided into one hundred parts, each part is the\ndimension of the åtmå. (Çvetåçvatara Upanißad 5.9)\nChapter 2\n47\neßo’√ur åtmå cetaså veditavyo\nyasmin prå√a˙ pañcadhå saµviveça\nprå√aiç cittaµ sarvam otam prajånåµ\nyasmin viçuddhe vibhavaty-eßa åtmå\nThe åtmå is atomic in size and can be perceived\nby perfect intelligence. This atomic åtmå is floating\nin the five kinds of airs, is situated in the heart,\nand spreads its influence all over the body of the\nembodied living beings. When the åtmå is purified\nfrom its contamination of the five kinds of material\nairs, its spiritual influence is exhibited. (Mu√∂aka\nUpanißad 3.1.9)\nThe cycle of birth and death (saµsåra) is described as\na natural phenomenon for one who is embodied. Although\nsuch a conception may be considered a fatalistic world\nview, both birth and death are an unwanted experience for\nthe embodied consciousness. After experiencing life, no\nsane person wants to die – everyone has the desire to live\nas long as possible.\nTo that end, nowadays the producers of wonder drugs\npromise us eternal life, although no such life-giving cures\nexist at present – everyone has to die and before death\ncomes, the wonder drugs and doctors fees are sure to bank-\nrupt the family fortune. However, death is an unnatural\nexperience. The fact that everyone seeks everlasting life\nshould be indicative that such a pure state of life exists\nbeyond birth and death. Indeed it does and Çrî K®ß√a will\nshed light on that subject as this chapter develops.\n48\nBhagavad-gita"

    "commentary": "The greatest fear that is mentioned in the above verse\nis the fear of losing the human form of life and taking\nbirth in an animal body or lower. Some people think of\nthe consciousness that is generally called åtmå as being\nhuman and other åtmås as being animal etc. But in reality\nno such distinction between a human åtmå and an animal\nåtmå exists. One transmigrates, according to one’s karma,\nthrough many lower species of life and eventually arrives\nat the human stage.\nHuman life offers one the opportunity of self-reali-\nsation or the chance to cultivate spiritual knowledge and\nawareness. One who attempts to become self-realised is\nnot always successful in one attempt or in one lifetime.\nHowever, Çrî K®ß√a gives us the assurance that even a\nlittle endeavour on the path of self-realisation will save\nus from the greatest fear, namely that of taking birth in a\nlower life form.\nThe perfection of self-realisation in the yoga system\nis called samådhi, or the complete absorption of our con-\nsciousness in the Supreme. The student of bhakti-yoga\nachieves such a state of self-realisation by following the\n54\nBhagavad-gita\ninstructions of Çrî K®ß√a with steady determination. This\nstate is only possible due to the great boon of having\nattained a human form of life.\nHowever, if one neglects the opportunity of self-real-\nisation in human life then one certainly runs the risk of\nsinking down into animal life or worse. It is sometimes\nargued that animals like cats and dogs have a better, more\ncomfortable life than many humans, and that is certainly\ntrue for many cats and dogs in western countries. But there\nis no guarantee that in losing the human form of life one\nwill become a dog or cat and be taken care of by a rich\nAmerican family. One may become an animal that is eaten\nalive by wild beasts or torn apart by predators in the sea.\nCertainly it goes without saying that such a life and death\nis full of suffering.\nTherefore, to avoid the unnecessary suffering found in\nanimal life, a person who has achieved the human platform\nshould, with great determination and diligence, pursue the\npath of self-realisation as outlined in Bhagavad-gîtå."

Yoga is the practice of becoming situ-\nated beyond the modes of nature. Everyone in the material\nworld is under the three modes of nature and only a true\nyogî can surpass these modes.\nOur activities are categorised in three ways – as action\nprescribed by the Vedas (karma), unauthorised action\n(vikarma) and transcendental action (akarma). Karma\nmeans those activities that derive a good result and some-\n58\nBhagavad-gita\ntimes promote one to higher planets or higher standards\nof living. Vikarma are those activities that are against the\nVedic injunctions and cause suffering to the self and to\nother living creatures. Akarma means those activities that\nhave neither good nor bad reactions.\nOne who is wise and who knows the science of yoga\nalways strives to perform the activities of akarma. Such\nyogîs are known as bhakti-yogîs and can easily situate them-\nselves in transcendence. Other systems of yoga such as\naß†å∫ga-yoga, råja-yoga, ku√∂alinî-yoga, ha†ha-yoga and\nkriyå-yoga can also reach transcendence, but the path is\nvery difficult, especially in this modern age.\nÇrî K®ß√a is known as Yogeçvara, the Supreme Master\nof yoga, and although Bhagavad-gîtå discusses other yoga\nsystems, it is the bhakti-yoga system that K®ß√a ultimately\nrecommends. The yogî situated in bhakti-yoga is always\nengaged in devotional activities to satisfy the Supreme\nMaster of yoga, Çrî K®ß√a. Thus, the bhakti-yogî is always\nin complete control of his senses. Without control of the\nsenses no one can perform meditation or engage in spiritual\npractices properly. Therefore, the bhakti-yogî is the top-\nmost yogî because he is engaged in the topmost yoga system.\nThere are eight mystical perfections of yoga known as the\naß†a-siddhis. These perfections are – becoming very small\n(a√imå-siddhi), becoming lighter than air (laghimå-siddhi),\nbeing able to retrieve anything from anywhere, such as\nextending one’s hand while in New York and picking a\nmango growing in India (pråpti-siddhi), to become heav-\nier than the heaviest (mahimå-siddhi), to create something\nwonderful or to destroy anything at will (îçitva-siddhi),  to\ncontrol the material elements (vaçitva-siddhi), the ability to\nChapter 2\n59\nfulfil all of one’s desires (pråkåmya-siddhi) and the ability\nto assume any form one wishes (kåmåvasåyitå-siddhi). As\nthe Master of yoga, K®ß√a has these eight yoga perfections\nin full.\nIt is sometimes claimed by yogîs that they have achieved\none or more of these aß†a-siddhis and such seems to have\nbeen relatively common in ancient times. But in modern\ntimes the claim of having one of the aß†a-siddhis, more often\nthan not, turns out to be fraudulent or simply a show to\nattract many followers. With the rise in popularity of yoga,\nfalse claims of aß†a-siddhis have become a lucrative business.\nA higher aspiration for the yogî is not the achievement\nof the aß†a-siddhis, but the achievement of samådhi in bhak-\nti-yoga because such achievement frees one from the cycle\nof birth and death."

How-\never, the senses of the bhakti-yogî who follows K®ß√a’s\ndirection are safeguarded because the senses are engaged\ntwenty-fours hours a day in K®ß√a’s service. As such, the\ntaste for sensual satisfaction gradually dries up and disap-\npears leaving the bhakti-yogî free to advance spiritually.\nOne who cannot control the senses cannot concentrate\nthe mind. Additionally, the senses are never actually satis-\nfied by material engagement. The senses become satiated\nfor sometime, but then again become stimulated with an\neven greater avarice. Those who are servants of the bodily\nsenses can never become masters of the self.\nBeing fully absorbed in pure spiritual consciousness or\nsamådhi means to be conscious of K®ß√a as the Supreme\nChapter 2\n63\nPerson. Such absorption of the mind and senses in K®ß√a\nis called K®ß√a consciousness."

One who\ndoes so at the time of death, attains brahma-nirvå√am,\nthe spiritual planets of Vaiku√†ha and the mitigation of\nall suffering.\nAccording to the knowledge of self-realised souls, the\nAbsolute Truth has three stages of realisation – Brahman,\nParamåtmå and Bhagavån.\nvadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvaµ yaj jñånam advayam\nbrahmeti paramåtmeti bhagavån iti çabdyate\nThe seers that know the Absolute Truth call this\nnon-dual substance Brahman, Paramåtmå or Bhaga-\nvån. (Çrîmad Bhågavatam 1.2.11)\nBrahman means attaining the impersonal light experi-\nence or effulgence of the Absolute. The word ‘Brahman’\nis found throughout the Vedic literature and according to\nscholars of bhakti-yoga, ultimately means Viß√u or K®ß√a.\nThe Buddhist philosophers take nirvå√a to be the end\nof material life and entering into the void, but Bhaga-\nvad-gîtå teaches differently. In the Vedic teachings there is\n68\nBhagavad-gita\nno void anywhere. Everything is the energy of the Absolute\nTruth and no existence or non-existence is reconcilable\noutside of that.\nAccording to the prominent sages of bhakti-yoga,\nViçvanåtha Cakravartî translates brahma-nirvå√am as lib-\neration. His disciple, Baladeva Vidyåbhüßa√a understands\nbrahma-nirvå√am as Paramåtmå who is Viß√u, the form\nof liberation. Råmånuja takes Brahman as the åtmå and\nnirvå√am as full of happiness. Madhva takes brahma-nir-\nvå√am as Viß√u/K®ß√a without a material form. Bhakti\nRakßaka Çrîdhara Mahåråja takes brahma-nirvå√am as\nfreedom from material bondage and A.C. Bhaktivedånta\nSvåmî Prabhupåda takes brahma-nirvå√am as meaning\nthe kingdom of Viß√u/K®ß√a. In all cases, the devotees\nof K®ß√a never accept liberation in the impersonal state of\nBrahman or the void because they are only interested in\nservice to K®ß√a and are already liberated.\nParamåtmå means realisation of the Absolute situated\nin the hearts of all living things – the Maintainer of the\nuniverse, being situated within and in between every parti-\ncle of matter.\nBhagavån is the realisation of the personal aspect of\nthe Absolute Truth and is considered to be the ultimate\nstage of self-realisation, because in that stage one realises\nthe Absolute Truth in toto as K®ß√a, the fountainhead of\nall energies. The abode of K®ß√a is known as Vaiku√†ha or\nGoloka V®ndåvana.\nFurthermore, verse 71 refers to the aha∫kåra, or the\nfalse ego, that is attached to consciousness when driven\nby the modes of material nature. False ego presupposes\nthe existence of real ego – that real ego being the pure\nChapter 2\n69\nconsciousness of a living being. Thinking oneself to be the\nmaterial body, or thinking oneself to be the enjoyer of the\nsenses, is the cause and the effect of false ego. Such false\nego never leads to enlightenment, but to repeated births\nand deaths in the cycle of saµsåra. The false ego is like a\nshadow of darkness that covers pure consciousness. The\npure ego is non-different from pure consciousness itself.\nPure ego is to realise oneself as part and parcel of the\nAbsolute Truth and eternal servant of K®ß√a.\nॐ तिदित ीमहाभारते शतसाहां संिहतायां\nवैयािसां भीपवािण ीमगवीतासूपिनष\nिवायां योगशाे ीकाजनसंवादे\nसांयोगो नाम ितीयोऽायः॥\noµ tat saditi çrî-mahåbhårate-çata-såhasryåµ saµhitåyåµ\nvaiyåsikyåµ bhîßma-parvå√i\nçrîmad bhagavad-gîtåsüpanißatsu\nbrahma-vidyåyåµ yoga-çåstre çrî k®ß√årjuna-saµvåde\nså∫khya yogo nåma dvitîyo’dhyåya˙\nOÂ TAT SAT – Thus ends Chapter Two entitled\nSå∫khya Yoga from the conversation between Çrî K®ß√a\nand Arjuna in the Upanißad known as Çrîmad Bhagavad-\ngîtå, the yoga-çåstra of divine knowledge, from the Bhîßma-\nparva of Mahåbhårata, the literature revealed by Vyåsa in\none hundred thousand verses.\nChapter 3\n73"

One is not complete without the other.\nEngagement, sometimes seen as spiritual practices, without\nphilosophy is merely sentiment and philosophy without\npractice is mental speculation. Religious practices without\na solid philosophical basis often lead to fanaticism that\nresults in destruction and death. Our modern world is all\ntoo aware of this.\nThe interdependent relationship between philosophy\nand spiritual practice is indispensable for one who wants\nto achieve the perfection of human life. Actions should\nbe performed with proper knowledge, only then does one\nachieve the proper result and is considered a true yogî."

No embodied being can give up action even for a\nChapter 3\n77\nmoment because in the material world everyone is forced\nto act under the influence of the modes of nature. It is also\nsaid that the pure nature of the åtmå is to be engaged in\nthe spiritual activities of serving the Supreme Being, K®ß√a.\nTherefore, all activities are to be connected to, and for the\nsatisfaction of Viß√u/K®ß√a. This is known as the consti-\ntutional position of the åtmå.\nIt is clear from the above verses that action is better\nthan inaction. As it is said, “An idle mind is the Devil’s\nworkshop.” If the senses are idle and one tries to empty\nthe mind, then what usually transpires is that the mind\nbecomes engaged in unproductive thoughts and eventually\nthe sense-objects carry the mind and senses away.\nThe influence of the modes of material nature over the\nåtmå is called måyå, or illusion.

    "commentary": "In verse 10 Brahmå is mentioned as the creator.\nAccording to the Vedas, Brahmå is the first living being in\nthis universe and is manifest directly by Viß√u. Brahmå’s\nfunction is as the secondary creator of the planetary sys-\ntems. In modern times, some atheistic thinkers, such as\nProfessor Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist\nfrom Oxford University, have conceded that aliens from\nanother planet may have possibly seeded life on Earth.\nFar-fetched as this may sound to some of us, the idea does\ncome very close to the truth.\nThe ancient texts of India state that Brahmå resides\nin the highest realm in the universe known as Satya-loka.\nSome of the offspring of Brahmå known as the Prajåpatis\nare then sent forth to seed life throughout the cosmos.\nBut rather than look at Brahmå as an alien, the Vedic\ntexts describe him as the father of all living beings in the\nmaterial world.\nSince western civilisation first came into contact with\nthe pantheon of Vedic demigods there has always been\nthe speculation that the Vedic people, often referred to\n80\nBhagavad-gita\nas Hindus, were pagans – pagan meaning the worshippers\nof many gods and not one Supreme God. Thus western\nobservers conclude that monotheism, the worship or rever-\nence of one Supreme God, originated with the Abrahamic\nreligions of the west. This however is not a fact.\nThe Vedic pantheon does indeed include many lesser\ndemigods, but the Vedic texts are quite clear that there\nis only one Supreme Being or Super Consciousness that\nis above all. That is always referred to as Brahman, Par-\namåtmå, Bhagavån, Viß√u or K®ß√a. For example, the ‰g\nVeda (1. 22. 20) states as follows:\ntad viß√o˙ paramaµ padaµ sadå paçyanti suraya˙\ndivîva cakßur åtatam\nThe divine feet of Viß√u are above all, like the sun\nabove our heads. His holy feet are like the vigilant\neye of a grand guardian over our heads like the sun.\nÇrîmad Bhågavatam says:\nete cåmça kalå˙ pumsa˙ k®ß√as tu bhagavån svayam\nThe various avatåras are either plenary expansions\nor parts of plenary expansions. But Çrî K®ß√a is\nthe original source of all these avatåras. (Çrîmad\nBhågavatam 1.3.28)\nHistorically speaking, it is erroneous to assume that\nmonotheism was developed by Abrahamic civilisations\nindependent of any outside influence. In fact, the Abra-\nhamic religions borrowed the idea of monotheism from the\nPersians after King Cyrus subjugated Babylon and Judea\nChapter 3\n81\ncirca 500 BCE. Prior to the arrival of the Persians, and\ncontinuing into the 2nd and 3rd Centuries, Judaism and\nChristianity were known to have belief systems based on\none or more gods. Thus, monotheism only gradually devel-\noped among the Abrahamic religions.\nSince the monotheistic concept found in the Vedas is\nmuch older than the Abrahamic religions, it is only logical\nto conclude that the latter borrowed their thinking from\nthe former. During the interim, the Persians, under the\ninfluence of Zoroaster, took the monotheistic philosophy\nfrom India and then transmitted it to the Middle Eastern\ncivilisations. Indeed, monotheism has always been the cen-\ntral theme of India’s Vedic literature.\nHowever, failing to look deeply into the philosophy\nof the Vedas or possibly being culturally intimidated by\nthe superiority of Vedic knowledge as opposed to western\nphilosophies and religions, Eurocentric academics and fun-\ndamental religionists have marginalised the ancient Vedic\ncivilisation of India. The German scholar Max Muller\npropagated further misinformation on this subject in the\n19th Century with the invention of the Aryan Invasion\nTheory, stating that Vedic civilisation did not originate in\nIndia. Yet all this is quite far from the truth.\nAccording to Muller, the åryans were a nomadic tribe\nfrom Europe who invaded India. Yet there is no evidence\nthat the åryans were nomads. In fact, to suggest that a\nnomadic tribe of barbarians wrote literature of such pro-\nfound wisdom as the Vedas defies imagination.\nFurthermore, within the Vedas, there is no mention what-\nsoever of an original homeland, and archaeologically there\nis a complete lack of evidence to prove an invasion ever\n82\nBhagavad-gita\noccurred. It can only be concluded that the åryan people\nand Vedic knowledge were always indigenous to India.\nThe Vedic knowledge is that Viß√u/K®ß√a is Supreme\nand the lesser gods and goddesses such as Brahmå, Çiva,\nGa√eça, Kårtikeya, Kålî and Sarasvatî etc. are actually serv-\nants of the Supreme Being and are empowered with the\nduties of managing the universal affairs of material nature.\nIn the above verses Çrî K®ß√a recommends that offerings\nshould be made to the demigods and thus the demigods\nwill be pleased to bestow unto humanity all the necessities\nof life. This is, in short, a universal law of taxation. In\nother words, we must give the demigods their dues.\nIt is also intrinsic to the nature of the åtmå, to perform\nservice and sacrifice. Constitutionally the åtmå, being part\nof the organic whole (the Absolute Truth), is duty-bound\nto serve the whole, both in this life and in eternity. When\nsacrifice or offerings are made to Viß√u such as fruits, veg-\netables etc. then one’s senses become purified by eating the\nremnants of such offerings. But if one takes the things of\nthis world without first acknowledging to whom they actu-\nally belong, then one simply incurs a karmic reaction. This\nalso includes our daily food that should first be offered\nto Viß√u/K®ß√a. It will be explained by Çrî K®ß√a later in\nBhagavad-gîtå that these food offerings should comprise\nof vegetables, fruits, milk products, flowers etc. Non-veg-\netarian food items cannot be offered to Viß√u or K®ß√a –\nconsequently the servants of Viß√u/K®ß√a are vegetarian.\nK®ß√a will also explain that those who serve the Absolute\nTruth are not duty-bound to serve the demigods, nor are\nthey bound by any other social consideration.\nChapter 3\n83"

It is no\nlonger something that is only available in India. There\nwill be more discussion on this particular topic in Chap-\nter 4, verse 8.\nThe proper mode of action and the proprietor of the\nresults of action is only understood when one is free from\nthe identification of the self as the body, as being a byprod-\nuct of the body or that one is the doer of activities.\nWe walk, we talk, we digest food, we construct build-\nings and even empires, but all these activities are made\npossible for us by a combination of material nature and\nthe Paramåtmå, the Super Consciousness that pervades\nthe entire universe. How all this transpires is inconceiva-\nble to those under the bodily conception of life. Thus the\nidea that, “I am this body” arising from the false ego must\nbe abandoned. Who are we? Where do we come from?\nWhy are we here? Is there life after death? The answers to\n90\nBhagavad-gita\nall these questions begin to fall into place when one gives\nup the concept of the body as the self. Many great thinkers\nfrom western civilisation have struggled with the ultimate\nquestions of life and death, but failed to find the answers\nor the solutions to the problems. This in part was due to\nthe fact that they contemplated life under the false premise\nthat the body is the self. Self-realisation and realisation of\nthe Absolute Truth begins with the abandonment of the\nbodily concept of life."

Envy, it seems, is purely evil as K®ß√a\nsays that those who do not follow the teachings of the\nBhagavad-gîtå out of enviousness are bereft of all knowl-\nedge and intelligence.\nAnother danger is the tendency of neglecting one’s own\nduty and trying to perform the duty of another. In other\nwords, K®ß√a tells Arjuna to tend to his own business.\nArjuna is a kßatriya and his duty, as already discussed, is to\nprotect and defend the kingdom. Arjuna however, is show-\ning leanings towards renunciation – becoming a monk, a\nsannyåsî. Arjuna wants to abandon his duty and perform\nthat of another, but K®ß√a warns him that this is not a\ngood idea. In fact, K®ß√a says it is even dangerous. K®ß√a\nexplains that it is better to perform one’s own duty imper-\nfectly than perform another’s duty perfectly.\nIn particular, K®ß√a is encouraging Arjuna to follow the\ncodes of conduct set down for kßatriyas – of which aban-\ndoning the battlefield for a warrior is not an option."

    "commentary": "Herein, it is stated that the mind is superior to the\nsenses and intelligence is superior to the mind, but above\nthe intelligence is the consciousness or åtmå. The mate-\nrial body is comprised of the mind, senses and intelligence\nand they are therefore considered as material elements. In\nChapter 7, verse 4 of Bhagavad-gîtå, Çrî K®ß√a lists the\neight material elements as earth, water, fire, air, space,\nmind, intelligence and false ego. Then, in the next verse,\nK®ß√a describes a superior energy known as jîva-bhüta, the\nChapter 3\n97\nunits of individual consciousness. K®ß√a says that this jîva-\nbhüta, also known as åtmå, is categorically different than\nthe material elements. It is fully spiritual.\nBut when lust, the all-devouring enemy of self-reali-\nsation, covers the mind, senses and intelligence of the\nsuperior jîva-bhüta, then the knowledge and realisation of\nthe jîva-bhüta are destroyed. Therefore, K®ß√a says that\nfirst the yogî must conquer lust. If one does not pursue\nthe cravings of lust and instead takes control of one’s\nlower self with one’s higher self, lust will eventually be\nvanquished. However, if one tries to satisfy his burning\nlust then it is like pouring fuel onto a fire.\nॐ तिदित ीमहाभारते शतसाहां संिहतायां\nवैयािसां भीपवािण ीमगवीतासूपिनष\nिवायां योगशाे ीकाजनसंवादे\nकमयोगो नाम तृतीयोऽायः॥\noµ tat saditi çrî-mahåbhårate-çata-såhasryåµ saµhitåyåµ\nvaiyåsikyåµ bhîßma-parvå√i\nçrîmad bhagavad-gîtåsüpanißatsu\nbrahma-vidyåyåµ yoga-çåstre çrî k®ß√årjuna-saµvåde\nkarma-yogo nåma t®tîyo’dhyåya˙\nOÂ TAT SAT – Thus ends Chapter Three entitled\nKarma Yoga from the conversation between Çrî K®ß√a and\nArjuna in the Upanißad known as Çrîmad Bhagavad-gîtå,\nthe yoga-çåstra of divine knowledge, from the Bhîßma-\nparva of Mahåbhårata, the literature revealed by Vyåsa in\none hundred thousand verses.\nChapter 4\n101"

K®ß√a says that previ-\nously He had spoken this knowledge of yoga to Vivasvån,\nthe predominating deity of the sun planet, and in turn\nVivasvån passed on this knowledge to other universal lead-\ners and great kings.

But in\ntime, the knowledge of yoga was lost and therefore K®ß√a\nwas again speaking Bhagavad-gîtå to Arjuna.\nThe qualifications to properly understand Bhagavad-gîtå\nare stated here. One should be a devotee of K®ß√a and one\nshould understand that K®ß√a is suh®dam-sarva-bhütånåm,\nthe friend of all living beings. In bhakti-yoga one does not\nfear God because K®ß√a is not a wrathful God. K®ß√a is\nour dear-most friend and our ever well-wisher. K®ß√a is the\nChapter 4\n103\nhighest subject of love, adoration and affection. K®ß√a also\nhas deep feelings of love for His devotees.\nFrom these verses we can also understand that the\nknowledge of yoga is not simply meant for studio lessons.\nThe knowledge of yoga is actually the most important\nbranch of knowledge in the world and as such, it should\nbe studied by every discerning person – from the heads\nof government to the individual citizen. Everyone should\nhave the opportunity to study and practice yoga, by which\none easily approaches the perfection of life.\nThe question naturally arises in Arjuna’s mind that how\ncould K®ß√a have spoken Bhagavad-gîtå to Vivasvån when\nVivasvån appeared in the universe millions of years ago\nand K®ß√a only appeared recently?"

K®ß√a\nis non-different from His body, whereas living beings in\nmaterial life are units of consciousness that are embod-\nied by material elements. The bodies of all living beings\nin the material world are made of the basic elements of\nearth, water, fire, air, space, mind, intelligence and false\nego. K®ß√a is sac-cid-ånanda – eternity, knowledge and\nbliss. K®ß√a’s body is also sac-cid-ånanda, thus K®ß√a and\nK®ß√a’s body are non-different. They are transcendental,\nspiritual substances.\nÇrî K®ß√a not only remembers all His previous births,\nbut He remembers all of Arjuna’s previous births also.\nThis is the characteristic of the Absolute Truth who is\nfully omniscient.\n106\nBhagavad-gita\nThe knowledge of yoga being lost naturally results in\na decline in dharma and a rise of adharma (false dharma).\nMalevolence arises out of adharma. When this occurs,\nK®ß√a says that He appears in the world to re-establish\nthe principles of dharma. Dharma is understood as duties,\nactivities and practices that will sustain the living beings\nin a state of prosperity and enable them to realise their\nconstitutional position as conscious parts and parcels of\nthe Absolute Truth, K®ß√a. As such, dharma should not be\nconfused with the mundane religions of this world.\nIn verse 8 K®ß√a says that He appears in every age (yuge\nyuge) to establish the yuga-dharma. In Satya-yuga, K®ß√a\nappeared as Haµsa, Matsya, Kürma, Varåha and Nar-\nasiµha avatåras. In Treta-yuga, He appeared as Våmana,\nParaçuråma and Råmacandra avatåras. In Dvåpara-yuga, He\nappeared as Çrî K®ß√a and in Kali-yuga, He has appeared as\nBuddha and Çrî Caitanya Mahåprabhu. There is one more\navatåra yet to appear at the end of Kali-yuga, some 427,000\nyears from now, and that is Kalki.\nWhen K®ß√a was speaking Bhagavad-gîtå, it was at the\nend of Dvåpara-yuga – an age of considerable piety where\nopen degradation such as establishments for the consump-\ntion of alcohol, illicit sex, political corruption, drug abuse\nand the organised slaughter of animals were completely\nunheard of. Now, five thousand years on, we are in the\nmidst of the age known as Kali-yuga where the unheard of\nvices in Dvåpara-yuga are the norm of the day.\nSimilarly, as K®ß√a had appeared at the end of Dvåpa-\nra-yuga, He again appeared after the first 4,576 years\nof Kali-yuga had passed as the avatåra, Çrî Caitanya\nMahåprabhu. Çrî Caitanya Mahåprabhu is also known as\nChapter 4\n107\nthe Kali-yuga avatåra, or the yugåvatåra. As the yugåvatåra,\nK®ß√a taught the dharma of nåma-sa∫kîrtana, the chant-\ning of the mahå-mantra as not only the most important\nprocess of self-realisation, but as the only recommended\nprocess of self-realisation in Kali-yuga. Conclusively, the\nB®han-Nåradîya Purå√a (38.126) says:\nharer-nåma harer-nåma harer-nåma eva kevalam\nkalau nåsty-eva nåsty-eva nåsty-eva gatir anyathå\nIn the age of Kali there is no other way, there is\nno other way, there is no other way except for the\nchanting of the names of K®ß√a.\nWhen the mahå-mantra is chanted congregationally in\na loud tone, it is called kîrtana or sa∫kîrtana. When the\nmahå-mantra is chanted softly and the repetition is counted\non a string of one hundred-and eight beads, it is called japa.\nSince the advent of Çrî Caitanya Mahåprabhu and the\nsa∫kîrtana movement, many great and learned scholars,\nphilosophers and yogîs such as Sårvabhauma Bha††åcårya\nand Prakåçånanda Sarasvatî have put aside other systems\nof yoga, Vedånta and philosophy in favour of becoming\nfully absorbed in the chanting of the holy names of K®ß√a.\nAccording to great self-realised personalities, the chanting\nof the mahå-mantra is the surest path to spiritual perfec-\ntion in this age. Çrîmad Bhågavatam states as follows:\nkaler doßa nidhe råjann asti hy eko mahån gu√a˙\nkîrtanåd eva k®ß√asya mukta-sa∫ga˙ paraµ vrajet\nAlthough Kali-yuga is an ocean of faults where\npeople are short-lived, slow and always disturbed,\n108\nBhagavad-gita\nstill there is one great quality about this age – simply\nby chanting the name of K®ß√a, one can be delivered\nfrom material bondage and attain the supreme desti-\nnation. (Çrîmad Bhågavatam 12.3.51)\nk®te yad dhyåyato viß√uµ tretåyåµ yajato makhai˙\ndvåpare paricaryåyåµ kalau taddhari-kîrtanåt\nWhatever results were gained in Satya-yuga by med-\nitating upon Viß√u, in Treta-yuga by performing\nelaborate sacrifices and in Dvåpara-yuga by Deity\nworship can be obtained in Kali-yuga simply by\nchanting the names of K®ß√a. (Çrîmad Bhågavatam\n12.3.52)\nThe chanting of the mahå-mantra advances one in\nself-realisation because it purifies the heart of material\ninfluences and eliminates the false conceptions of life,\nthus terminating the cycle of birth and death. Çrî Caitanya\nMahåprabhu has composed a verse wherein the benefits of\nsa∫kîrtana, chanting the mahå-mantra, have been described\nas follows:\nceto-darpa√a-mårjanaµ bhava mahå-dåvågni nirvåpa√aµ\nçreya˙ -kairava-candrikå-vitara√aµ vidyå-vadhü-jîvanam\nånandåmbudhi-vardhanaµ prati-padaµ pür√åm®tåsvådanaµ\nsarvåtma-snapanaµ paraµ vijayate çrî k®ß√a-sa∫kîrtanam\nThe holy name of K®ß√a cleanses the mirror of the\nheart and extinguishes the fire of misery in the forest\nof birth and death. Just as the evening lotus blooms\nin the moon’s cooling rays, the heart begins to blos-\nsom in the nectar of K®ß√a’s name. And at last the\nChapter 4\n109\nåtmå awakens to its real inner treasure – a life of\nlove with K®ß√a. Again and again tasting nectar, the\nåtmå dives and surfaces in the ever-increasing ocean\nof ecstatic joy. All phases of the self of which we\nmay conceive are fully satisfied and purified, and at\nlast conquered by the all-auspicious influence of the\nholy name of K®ß√a. (Çikßåß†aka 1)\nÇrî Caitanya Mahåprabhu taught the chanting of the\nmahå-mantra and a complete system of philosophy known\nas acintya-bhedåbheda-tattva that has encompassed all the\ngreat philosophical systems of India that preceded Him,\nsuch as Ådi Ça∫kara’s advaita, Viß√u Svåmî’s çuddhådvaita,\nNimbårka’s dvaitådvaita, Råmånuja’s viçiß†hådvaita and\nMadhva’s dvaita. The acintya-bhedåbheda-tattva philoso-\nphy is essentially the philosophy of simultaneous oneness\nand difference in the Absolute Truth, culminating in pre-\nma-bhakti or divine love. As such, Çrî Caitanya Mahåprabhu\nhas revealed the greatest philosophy of spiritual perfection\nin this world.\nTo accompany the chanting of the mahå-mantra the\nprocess of Deity worship that was prominent in Dvåpa-\nra-yuga is still in vogue today. The Deity is the arca-vi-\ngraha representation of Çrî K®ß√a that is manifest before\nthe aspirant so that one can perform arcana (worship)\nand fix the mind and senses on the form of the Supreme\nPerson. When the authorised arca-vigraha is present, such\nworship should not be confused with the worship of life-\nless and unauthorised idols. Current in the communities\nof bhakti-yoga are the worship of the arca-vigrahas of Çrî\nK®ß√a such as Jagannåtha, Pañca-tattva, Gaura-Nitåi, Gau-\nra-Gadådhara, Çrî Narasiµha and Çrî Çrî Rådhå-K®ß√a.\n110\nBhagavad-gita"

    "commentary": "In verse 10 Çrî K®ß√a alludes to the topmost stage of\nself-realisation by the use of the word bhåva. Bhåva is the\nstage of deep affection just before one reaches the stage of\npurest love, prema. Rüpa Gosvåmî, the foremost disciple of\nÇrî Caitanya Mahåprabhu, explains this in great detail in\nhis book, Bhakti-rasåm®ta-sindhu (1.4.15-16).\nådau çraddhå tata˙ sådhu-sa∫go‘tha bhajana-kriyå\ntato’nartha-niv®tti˙ syåt tato niß†hå rucis tata˙\nathåsaktis tato bhåvas-tata˙ premåbhyudañcati,\nsådhakånåm ayaµ prem√a˙ prådurbhåve bhavet krama˙\nThe development of transcendental love begins with\nçraddhå or faith. Çraddhå leads one to associate with\nspiritually advanced persons, sådhu-sa∫ga. In the\nassociation of sådhus one receives çikßa, or instruc-\ntions on how to approach the Absolute Truth, and\ngradually one is initiated into this process. This\nis called bhajana-kriyå. When the heart is cleared\nof contamination, one reaches the stage of being\npure-hearted (anartha-niv®tti). By the cultivation\nof spiritual practices after achieving anartha-niv®tti,\none becomes steady (niß†ha), and achieves the state of\nruci, wherein one begins to taste the pure sweetness\nof realisation in the Absolute Truth. This ruci devel-\nops further to become åsakti, or great attachment\nfor the Absolute. Great attachment for the Absolute\ngradually manifests as great feelings of affection for\nÇrî K®ß√a. This is called bhåva. And the mature stage\nof those feelings of affection are known as prema,\nor the sentiments of transcendental love for K®ß√a.\nChapter 4\n113\nIt is interesting to note that K®ß√a hints at this ulti-\nmate perfection early on in Bhagavad-gîtå, not too overtly\nbut slightly covertly – for love, after all, is the greatest of\nall secrets.\nIn subsequent verses, K®ß√a continues to encourage\nArjuna not to adopt the path of inaction. K®ß√a assures\nArjuna that He is transcendental to all types of karma and\nthat those who take refuge in Him also become liberated\nfrom the reactions of material activities.\nK®ß√a wants Arjuna to follow the example of pre-\nviously liberated persons – to follow in their footsteps,\nmahåjano yena gata˙ sa panthå˙. In ancient times there were\nmany great personalities known as mahåjanas and they all\nachieved liberation from birth and death by taking shelter\nof K®ß√a. K®ß√a wants Arjuna to follow these mahåjanas.\nÇrî K®ß√a is awarding all living beings accordingly as\nthey approach Him. Knowingly or unknowingly everyone\nis searching for K®ß√a. K®ß√a is the reservoir of pleasure\nand the primeval cause of everything. In Brahma-saµhitå,\nÇrî K®ß√a is described as sarva-kåra√a-kåra√am, the cause\nof all causes. K®ß√a is also known as Govinda, or one who\ngives pleasure to the senses. But due to being under the\nillusion of bodily consciousness, the living beings are not\naware of what is actually in their best interest, therefore\nthey do not approach K®ß√a directly. Instead, the bewil-\ndered living beings worship demigods for the fulfilment\nof their desires, or as in modern society, they simply work\nhard to earn money and purchase whatever they want.\nIn material existence, the living beings are wandering\nthroughout the universe in different species of life, expe-\nriencing happiness and distress according to their karma.\n114\nBhagavad-gita\nbrahmå√∂a bhramite kona bhågyavån jîva\nguru-k®ß√a-prasåde påya bhakti-latå-bîja\nOut of millions of wandering living beings, one who\nis most fortunate gets an opportunity to associate\nwith a liberated person (guru) by the grace of K®ß√a.\nBy the mercy of K®ß√a and the guru, such a person\nreceives the seed of the creeper of bhakti. (Caitan-\nya-caritåm®ta, Madhya-lîlå 19.151)\nThe world is old – much older than many of us real-\nise and many things have changed over the ages. Yet the\nbasic principles of spiritual advancement and putting an\nend to the problems of birth, death, old age and disease\nremain the same. The advancement of modern civilisation\nhas actually done very little to solve the real problems of\nlife. We are given so-called higher education and better\nstandards of living, yet the basic problems remain – birth,\ndeath, old age and disease. Now the real solution is at hand\nand Çrî K®ß√a wants Arjuna to accept it.\nTo facilitate social harmony, efficiency and advance-\nment in spiritual life, K®ß√a has created the four social\norders in society called var√as. According to one’s suk®ti,\nor spiritual merits derived from previous lifetimes, one\ncomes to the human form of life with certain innate qual-\nities. This is a natural system of order in the universe and\nit is perceivable in all civilised societies. These human\ntendencies are grouped into four basic classifications: the\nintellectual, martial, mercantile and labourer classes. The\nVedic terms for these are bråhma√as, kßatriyas, vaiçyas and\nçüdras. According to Çrî K®ß√a these var√as are determined\nby one’s qualities and actions (gu√a-karma) and not simply\nChapter 4\n115\nby birth. One may be born in the family of workmen but\nshow extraordinary intellectual prowess and so forth. As\nsuch, one is to be heartily welcomed into the intellectual\ncommunity. Similarly, one may be born to a wealthy mer-\ncantile family but show great promise as a military leader.\nThus one is encouraged to follow that line of work.\nWhen one performs the work prescribed to him accord-\ning to his qualities, and devotes that work to please the\nSupreme Person K®ß√a, then such a person achieves the\nhighest perfection. This is confirmed as follows:\nata˙ pumbhir dvija-çreß†hå var√åçrama-vibhågaça˙\nsvanuß†hitasya dharmasya saµsiddhir hari-toßa√am\nIt is concluded that the highest perfection one can\nachieve by discharging one’s occupational duties\naccording to the var√a and åçrama orders of life is\nto please K®ß√a. (Çrîmad Bhågavatam 1.2.13)\nUnfortunately, in modern times some persons have\ngiven a wrong interpretation to the eligibility of the var√as\nby placing all emphasis on one’s birth in a particular\nfamily. This has been invented to create a sense of social\nsuperiority wherein elite members of Vedic society who\nare born as bråhma√as and kßatriyas are given special priv-\nileges, while others who are born as vaiçyas and çüdras are\nnot. This system has created havoc in India for more than\none thousand years and is known as the caste system. The\ncaste system however is a total misrepresentation of the\nsystem of var√as created by K®ß√a.\n116\nBhagavad-gita"

    "commentary": "We have already discussed previously the different types\nof action such as karma (prescribed duties), vikarma (for-\nbidden actions) and akarma (spiritual activities). None-\ntheless it is sometimes difficult to understand the different\ntypes of action, and especially to see inaction in action\nand action within inaction. Indeed, this seems quite con-\ntradictory. In contemporary society, especially in various\nyoga communities, karma is often spoken of without a clear\nunderstanding of what it actually is or how it is incurred.\nChapter 4\n119\nThe point Çrî K®ß√a wants to make clear is that actions\nperformed for His satisfaction do not have any reaction\nin the sphere of karma or vikarma. Actions performed\nfor K®ß√a are in the category of akarma, producing only\nspiritual benefit – no good or bad material effect. Good\nand bad karma are both material and as such they must\nbe shaken off before one can become spiritually liberated.\nGenerally we want good karma, but good karma means\nwe will have to take birth again and enjoy its good effects.\nBad karma, of course, is commonly understood as some-\nthing undesirable or to be avoided because it causes suffer-\ning, pain and distress. This is certainly true, but bad karma\nis simply the flip side of good karma and vice versa. This\nis called the karmic entanglement of material life – some-\ntimes enjoying and sometimes suffering.\nAkarma leads to liberation from all material entangle-\nment and takes one to the plane of eternal blissful life in\nfull knowledge of everything. While engaging in yoga, a\nserious student should, as far as possible, lead a simple life\nbeyond duality by minimizing material hankerings, con-\ntrolling the mind and body and giving up possessiveness.\nBeing content with that which comes of its own accord,\none should remain steadfast in the practice of yoga."

    "commentary": "The above verses principally deal with sacrifice and sac-\nrifices of different types. However, it should be mentioned\nat the outset that Çrî K®ß√a does not recommend animal\nsacrifices. The very word ‘sacrifice’ conjures up images of\nbloodshed – and rightfully so. In the history of religions\nthroughout the world, from antiquity to modernity, the\nsacrifice of both animals and humans has been a common\npractice. Most progressive thinkers however now view\nChapter 4\n123\nhuman and animal sacrifice as totally repugnant and cer-\ntainly Çrî K®ß√a would be in complete agreement.\nThe sacrifices mentioned here by K®ß√a mainly concern\nthe performance of austerities, breath control, study of the\nVedas, purification of knowledge, renunciation, observing\nvows etc. The purpose of all such sacrifices is to advance\nin realisation of the Absolute Truth.\nIt is often said that, “God is one” or that, “It is all\none”. This is true, but there is a need to qualify such state-\nments. God is the Absolute Truth, one without a second,\nbut this does not mean that all living beings are God. The\nBhagavad-gîtå is straightforward on the point that all living\nbeings are eternally individual and never become God at\nany time. Similarly, God is always the Absolute Truth and\nnothing less.\nIt is said in verse 24 that the utensils of sacrifice are\nAbsolute, the sacred fire is Absolute, the priest or per-\nformer of sacrifice is Absolute and one who is always\nabsorbed in thoughts of the Absolute attains the Absolute.\nThis is not to say that the individuality of any of these is\nlost in the Absolute. Everything that comes in contact with\nthe Absolute Truth acquires the qualities of the Absolute\nby association, but the individuality of each is maintained.\nThe point is also made that practically everything in\nlife depends on sacrifice, even worldly pleasures. Without\nsacrifice one cannot enjoy in this life or in the next. The\nknowledge of performing sacrifice is essential for the stu-\ndents of yoga. Knowing this one becomes liberated.\n124\nBhagavad-gita"

    "commentary": "As per the understanding of advanced students and mas-\nters of Bhagavad-gîtå, Çrî K®ß√a’s instruction in verse 34 is\nthat one should try to understand the truth by approaching\na tattva-darçî, one who has seen the truth, with an attitude\n126\nBhagavad-gita\nof submissive inquiry (paripraçna) and service (sevå). Being\nsatisfied by such submissive inquiry and service, the tatt-\nva-darçî will instruct and initiate the disciple in the sacred\nscience of yoga. In other words, K®ß√a is telling Arjuna\nthat to know the truth he must approach a spiritual master\n(guru) and become his disciple.\nguru-pådåçrayas-tasmåt k®ß√a-dîkßådi-çikßa√am\nviçrambhe√a guro˙ sevå sådhu-vartmånu-vartanam\nFirstly one must surrender at the feet of the guru,\nreceive training from him by accepting spiritual initi-\nation and instructions regarding Çrî K®ß√a, serve the\nguru with affection and follow in the footsteps of the\nsådhus. (Bhakti-rasåm®ta-sindhu 1.2.74)\nAs the representative of K®ß√a, the instruction of the\nguru, or åcårya, should be heeded. The genuine guru is a\nrepresentative of K®ß√a (Paramåtmå) and is of two types –\ndîkßå and çikßå. The dîkßå-guru gives initiation and accepts\nthe student or disciple as a member of the paramparå. Such\ninitiations are not secret and are held in plain view of the\npublic, but at the initiation ceremony the disciple receives\nthe mahå-mantra and gåyatrî-mantras for meditation. The\nçikßå-guru is one who imparts practical instructions to the\ndisciple for the progressive advancement in self-realisation.\nThe function of dîkßå and çikßå may be performed by the\nsame guru, or by different gurus, but in any case both the\ndîkßå and çikßå gurus must be representatives of K®ß√a.\nThus, one should see the guru as non-different from K®ß√a\nand should offer him all respect. K®ß√a confirms this in\nÇrîmad Bhågavatam as follows:\nChapter 4\n127\nåcåryaµ måµ vijånîyån nåvamanyeta karhicit\nna martya-buddhyåsüyeta sarva-deva-mayo guru˙\nOne should consider the åcårya (guru) as non-dif-\nferent from Myself and never show any disrespect\ntowards him. One should not envy him, nor con-\nsider him to be an ordinary person as he is the rep-\nresentative of all the demigods. (Çrîmad Bhågavatam\n11.17.27)\nThis is the guru-disciple relationship that has been\naccepted since time immemorial. However, the question\narises as to who is a guru? What are the qualifications of\na guru? It is clear that the disciple’s mood should be one\nof eagerness to know the truth accompanied by submissive\ninquiry and service. But what of the guru – what are his\nqualifications?\nThe Bhagavad-gîtå says that the guru must be one\nwho has seen the truth (a tattva-darçî) and who knows\nthe science of K®ß√a consciousness. This presupposes\nthat the guru is himself a disciple of the previous guru.\nThis is known as the guru-paramparå or the guru-disci-\nple succession. Bhagavad-gîtå sets the standards to acquire\nentrance into knowledge of the Absolute Truth and what\nthat Truth is. K®ß√a is the principle speaker of the Bhaga-\nvad-gîtå and therefore the guru must necessarily be in the\nparamparå of K®ß√a.\nThe first qualification of the guru is that he must be\nin an authentic paramparå and he must teach his disciple\nthe principles and conclusions of Bhagavad-gîtå. There are\nfour paramparås and one should learn the philosophy of\n128\nBhagavad-gita\nBhagavad-gîtå from one of those paramparås. Çrî Baladeva\nVidyåbhüßa√a has mentioned these four paramparås in his\nbook Prameya-ratnåvalî:\nsampradåya vihînå ye mantrås te nißphalå matå˙\nata˙ kalau bhavißyanti catvåra˙ sampradåyina˙\nçrî brahma rudra sanakå˙ vaiß√avå˙ kßiti-påvanå˙\ncatvåras te kalau bhåvyå hy-utkale purußottamåt\nråmånujaµ çrî˙ svîcakre madhvåcåryaµ catur-mukha˙\nçrî viß√u-svåminaµ rudro nimbådityaµ catu˙sana˙\nThat mantra that is not received in a disciplic suc-\ncession does not produce any result. Thus, in Kali-\nyuga there are four sampradåyas (paramparås). They\nare the Çrî, Brahmå, Rudra and Sanaka sampradåyas.\nRåmånuja is the åcårya of the Çrî sampradåya,\nMadhva is the åcårya of the Brahmå sampradåya,\nViß√u Svåmî is the åcårya of the Rudra sampradåya\nand Nimbåditya is the åcårya of the Sanaka sam-\npradåya. (Prameya-ratnåvalî 1.5-7)\nThe Vedas conclude that Çrî K®ß√a is the Absolute\nTruth and all living beings are His parts and parcels. The\nKa†ha Upanißad states:\nnityo’nityånåµ cetanaç cetanånåm\neko bahünåµ yo vidadhåti kåmån\nHe is the Prime Eternal amongst all eternals. He\nis the Supreme Conscious Being amongst conscious\nbeings, and He alone is maintaining all life. (Ka†ha\nUpanißad 2.2.13)\nChapter 4\n129\nHowever, despite this, unscrupulous persons still\nattempt to make a trade with K®ß√a’s words in Bhaga-\nvad-gîtå and instead of declaring K®ß√a to be the Supreme\nConscious Being, they put themselves forward as being\nK®ß√a or God incarnate. Such so-called gurus are actu-\nally not gurus, but cheaters. This is explained by Çiva in\nPadma Purå√a:\nguravo bahava˙ santi çißya-vittåpa hårakå˙\ndurlabha˙ sad-gurur devî çißya-santåpa håraka˙\nThere are many gurus who will take the wealth of\ntheir disciples, but it is rare to find a true guru who\nwill remove the ignorance and miseries of a disciple.\nThe cheaters make a big show of spiritual advancement\nbut in reality they are spiritually bankrupt. Only a genuine\nrepresentative of K®ß√a can be guru or a teacher of the\nBhagavad-gîtå. This is the conclusion of all tattva-darçîs."

    "translation": "That state which is achieved by renunciation is also attained\nby karma-yoga. One who sees these two systems as one and\nthe same actually sees things as they are.",
    "commentary": "The Vedic system recommends four spiritual orders\nof life called åçråmas. These are brahmacårî, g®hastha,\nvånaprastha and sannyåsa. Brahmacårîs are the celibate stu-\ndents. G®hasthas are the family units, vånaprasthas are the\nretired members of society and sannyåsîs are the completely\nChapter 5\n137\nrenounced persons who live a life of sacrifice, austerity and\ncultivation of knowledge. Sannyåsîs are considered to be at\nthe crest of all social and spiritual orders of life.\nVedic scholars sometimes debate whether sannyå-\nsa-yoga (complete renunciation of activities) or karma-yoga\n(actions performed selflessly) is better. Çrî K®ß√a says in\nBhagavad-gîtå that both sannyåsa-yoga and karma-yoga are\nfavourable for liberation. Both paths ultimately lead to the\nsame goal, but of the two, the path of karma-yoga is pref-\nerable. This subject is controversial among some scholars\nbecause, according to their understanding, karma-yoga is\nthe performance of philanthropic works that are beneficial\nto the downtrodden section of society such as the poor and\nthe hungry. Such welfare work is indeed noble, but one\nshould understand that when K®ß√a speaks of karma-yoga\nin the Gîtå, He is specifically speaking about activities\nthat are performed for His satisfaction and pleasure. Such\nactivities are also known as karma-yoga or bhakti-yoga\nbecause the result of action is offered to K®ß√a. In other\nwords, noble philanthropic activities are ‘good karma’ but\nnot karma-yoga, unless they are offered to K®ß√a and per-\nformed on His behalf.\nWhen karma-yoga is established as bhakti-yoga then\nits superior advantage over sannyåsa-yoga is immediately\nunderstood. Sannyåsa-yoga is very, very difficult to exe-\ncute. One has to strictly control the senses and renounce\neven the simplest comforts of life such as a warm bath,\ncomfortable sleeping place etc. One has to live in the\nforest, fast regularly and observe other austerities such as\nsexual abstinence. For most people, this is very difficult,\nif not impossible.\n138\nBhagavad-gita\nKarma-yoga (bhakti-yoga) on the other hand, is easily\nadoptable by anyone at any stage and leads quickly to the\nultimate goal of life. In karma-yoga one performs devo-\ntional activities and follows basic principles of purity such\nas no intoxication, no illicit sex, no gambling and no eating\nof meat, fish or eggs. These principles can be easily adopted\nby anyone. Similarly, the devotional activity of chanting\nthe mahå-mantra (hare k®ß√a hare k®ß√a k®ß√a k®ß√a hare\nhare, hare råma hare råma råma råma hare hare) is also\neasily taken up along with meditation on the form of Çrî\nK®ß√a. Mantra meditation is the recommended process of\nworshipping K®ß√a in Kali-yuga. Therefore karma-yoga is\ngiven first preference in Bhagavad-gîtå.\nHowever, when sannyåsa-yoga is dovetailed with kar-\nma-yoga and the sannyåsî performs any and all sacrifices,\nausterities and shares the knowledge of Bhagavad-gîtå with\nothers, according to the desires of K®ß√a, then such a san-\nnyåsî becomes most perfect and is naturally accepted as the\nguru or teacher of both paths."

Vibhu literally means ‘omnipresent’ and\nthis refers to Çrî K®ß√a, the Supreme Conscious Being.\nWhen consciousness is omnipresent the conclusion is\nthat it is omniscient also. Omniscience and omnipresence\ndenote K®ß√a. Arjuna however, and other living beings of\nhis status, are called anu or finite. K®ß√a, the Absolute\nTruth, is infinite and the living beings are finite.\n144\nBhagavad-gita\nIt is sometimes thought that God, somehow or other,\ndies for the sins of the world. This is not a very intelligent\nidea, nor is it consistent with the spiritual science found in\nBhagavad-gîtå. K®ß√a says that He does not cause anyone\nto perform pious or impious activities nor does he accept\nthe reaction of anyone’s actions. The idea that God dies\nfor our sins is rejected. God is eternal; therefore He cannot\nand does not die. The living beings are also eternal, but\nbecause they are under the bodily concept of life, when\nthe body dies they also experience death – although they\nactually do not die. Both the Absolute Truth and His parts\nand parcels are eternal, beyond death.\nIn verse 18 the relative vision of equality is expressed\nfor one who is situated in transcendental knowledge. The\nwise man (pa√∂ita) sees all living beings equally, as units\nof eternal consciousness. The distinction between vari-\nous bodies is only an apparent difference between living\nbeings. According to the B®had-Viß√u Purå√a, there are\n8,400,000 different species of material bodies:\njalajå nava-lakßå√i sthåvarå lakßa-viµçati˙\nk®mayo rudra-sa∫khyakå˙ pakßinåµ daça-lakßakam\ntriµçal-lakßå√i paçavaç-catur-lakßå√i månußå˙\nThere are 900,000 aquatic species and 2,000,000\nnon-moving species such as trees and plants. There\nare 1,100,000 species of insects and reptiles and\n1,000,000 species of birds. There are 3,000,000\nvarieties of quadrupeds and 400,000 species of\nhuman beings.\nThe unit of individual consciousness, the åtmå, transmi-\ngrates through these various species from one to the other\nChapter 5\n145\nuntil it eventually reaches the human form of life. This\nprocess is known as transmigration, or reincarnation. It is\nsimilar to the theory of evolution, but distinctly different\nat the same time. In the Vedic concept the species of life\nare not evolving one into the other (though change within\nspecies is accepted), rather it is the åtmå that is evolving in\nconsciousness while transmigrating from one species to the\nnext. In the human form of life, consciousness reaches its\ncompleteness through the process of yoga.\nTherefore, a wise man does not discriminate between\none person and another based on bodily differences. The\nwise see the åtmå present in all forms of life and not just\nin human life."

    "commentary": "In the last verse of this chapter Çrî K®ß√a declares that\nHe is bhoktåraµ yajña-tapasåµ, the ultimate enjoyer and\nreceiver of all sacrifice and austerities. K®ß√a then says that\nHe is sarva-loka-maheçvaram, the Controller of all planets.\nSome modern systems of yoga recommend that one med-\nitate by thinking of oneself to be controlling and moving\nthe planets. This is completely absurd. When one is unable\nto control the affairs of the world that surrounds him, how\nthen is he able to control the movements of the planets?\nThis is not actually meditation – it is self-deception.\nÇrî K®ß√a concludes by saying that He is suh®daµ sar-\nva-bhütånåµ, the true friend of all living beings. By far,\nthe K®ß√a conception of the Absolute Truth is the broad-\nest, most complete, in-depth and convincing idea of God\nknown to human society. There are many conceptions of\nthe ultimate source of life being the all-powerful creator\nand controller of the universe, but the K®ß√a conception\nis the only concept of ultimate reality that embraces a love\naffair with God as a dear-most friend. This is exclusive\nChapter 5\n149\nto the K®ß√a conception, therefore it is considered as the\ntopmost theology, or topmost yoga system.\nK®ß√a says, jñåtvå måµ çåntim ®cchati – knowing this,\none attains peace. If ever there were something that was\nelusive in this world then certainly it is peace. Peace is\ntalked about everywhere but it is rare, if not impossible\nto find.

    "commentary": "Many commentators on Bhagavad-gîtå have mentioned\nthat the method of meditation spoken of in the Sixth\nChapter is derived from the eightfold process of yoga\nknown as aß†å∫ga-yoga. The famous compiler of the Yoga-\nsütras, Patañjali has explained the sequential order of the\naß†å∫ga-yoga system as follows:\nFirst, one should practice yama that consists of obser-\nvances such as rising from bed before sunrise, taking bath,\nstudy of the Vedas and performing püjå (rituals).\nNiyama consists of controlling the senses by following\nregulative principles such as no intoxication, no illicit sex,\nno gambling and no eating of meat, fish or eggs.\nNext one begins the practice of åsana by physically\nconditioning the body through systematic bodily exercises\nand postures aimed at toning and bringing into balance\none’s entire physical organism.\n156\nBhagavad-gita\nThen one advances to the performance of prå√åyåma,\ncontrolling the inward and outward breath by systematic\nbreathing exercises performed in conjunction with vari-\nous åsanas. When åsanas and prå√åyåma are performed\nor taught just for the sake of health, this is sometimes\ncalled ha†ha-yoga.\nAfter prå√åyåma follows pratyåhåra, or withdrawing\nthe senses from the sense-objects and training the mind to\nbecome introspective and intuitively orientated. Then one\nis able to concentrate the mind on a single point without\nbeing disturbed. This is known as dhåra√å, or attaining\nconcentration.\nOnce having acquired the ability to concentrate the\nmind without distractions from external sources, one can\nbegin actual meditation, or dhyåna. There are many forms\nof meditation in the yoga system, however none of them\nrecommend concentrating on nothingness. The three prin-\nciple objects of meditation in yoga are Brahman (transcen-\ndental light), Paramåtmå (localised Super Consciousness)\nand Bhagavån (Çrî K®ß√a).\nSamådhi is the final stage of aß†å∫ga-yoga wherein the\nyogî, at the time of quitting the material body, attains the\nobject of his desired perfection. The yogîs who desire Brah-\nman or Paramåtmå realisation enter the brahma-jyoti after\ngiving up their body and the yogî who desires Bhagavån\nrealisation enters into the Supreme Abode of K®ß√a known\nas Vaiku√†ha or Goloka V®ndåvana to associate with and\nparticipate in transcendental pastimes with K®ß√a.\nAccording to many masters of yoga, only Bhagavån real-\nisation is eternal. Even after attaining Brahman or Para-\nmåtmå realisations and merging into the Supreme Brahman,\nChapter 6\n157\na yogî will once again have to come back to the material\nworld and begin again the cycle of birth and death. This\nis said to be due to the intrinsic nature of all living beings\nto perform activities. Although in the brahma-jyoti there\nis a sense of bliss that is many thousands of times greater\nthan material happiness, still the desire to act remains. But\nbecause the Brahman realised yogî and the Paramåtmå real-\nised yogî are not qualified to perform devotional activities\nin the association of K®ß√a, they cannot enter the spiritual\nplanets and must therefore come down to take birth again\nin the material world."

    "commentary": "Çrî K®ß√a again informs Arjuna in verse 15 that the final\ngoal of yoga is to attain His Supreme Abode (Vaiku√†ha\nor Goloka V®ndåvana). This is indeed the ultimate goal of\nthe yoga system.\nOne cannot be a yogî if one eats too much or not\nenough. Eating too much also means eating things like\nnon-vegetarian foodstuff to maintain the body. This is not\nactually required. Nor can one be a yogî if one does not eat\nenough. This also means that one should not abstain from\neating milk products by considering it as non-vegetarian.\nMilk is the most complete food possible. Milk products\nhelp to develop a strong bodily constitution and nourish\nour brain cells and thus our thinking capacity. Yoga is\nsomething that has been practiced in India for thousands\nof years and from then until now, yogîs have recommended\ntaking milk and milk products like yogurt and cheese etc.\nOnly in recent times have some people thought it bad to\nChapter 6\n161\ntake milk products, but the masters of yoga have never rec-\nommended such abnegation.\nProper sitting posture, control of the senses and observ-\ning celibacy are also recommended in the above verses\nbecause without such practices no one can actually be a\nyogî. Gazing at the tip of the nose without casting one’s\nglance in other directions means being perfectly concen-\ntrated, as in dhåra√å, and performing dhyåna, or medita-\ntion on K®ß√a as the highest goal.\nAs far as possible, a yogî should try to live in a holy\nplace to practice yoga. In India yogîs are fond of residing on\nthe banks of the Ganges at Haridvåra, H®ßîkeça, Benares,\nor Måyåpura, or on the banks of another sacred river like\nthe Yamunå, Kåverî or Godåvarî. Some yogîs prefer the\nsanctuary of the Himålayas, others prefer residence in the\ncåra-dhåma (Dvårakå, Badarînåtha, Jagannåtha Purî and\nRåmeçvaram). In any case, the yogî must choose the proper\nplace to practice yoga.\nIf one is unable to live in a holy place or on the banks\nof a sacred river, then one should try to live in an åçrama\nor yoga community. If one is unable to live in a yoga com-\nmunity then one should sanctify one’s home by creating a\nplace where K®ß√a can be worshipped and mantra medita-\ntion can be performed. The home should have an atmos-\nphere conducive for contemplation, study and controlling\nthe senses. Such a home should be peaceful and free from\nacts of violence, animal killing, intoxication etc.\nIn this modern age (Kali-yuga) animal killing, intoxi-\ncation and so many other unfavourable activities are to be\nfound everywhere. Subsequently, it is very difficult to find\nthe appropriate place for yoga practice, especially for the\n162\nBhagavad-gita\npractice of aß†å∫ga-yoga, råja-yoga, ha†ha-yoga and so on.\nTherefore, in Kali-yuga the recommended process is bhak-\nti-yoga and meditation is performed through the chanting\nof the mahå-mantra.\nhare k®ß√a hare k®ß√a k®ß√a k®ß√a hare hare\nhare råma hare råma råma råma hare hare\nThe chanting of the mahå-mantra is so powerful and\npurifying that, wherever it is chanted, it makes that place\npurified. Thus the bhakti-yoga process can be practiced\neverywhere and anywhere. Bhakti-yoga is actually the only\nrecommended process of yoga in Kali-yuga.\nThe yogî must always strive for self-satisfaction, knowl-\nedge and realisation. Such a yogî will always see everything\nin this world with equal vision and therefore will not\nbecome attached to anything of a temporary nature. K®ß√a\nsays that the yogî sees gold and mere stones as the same.\nThis is not to say that the yogî cannot distinguish the bril-\nliance of gold from that of ordinary objects; this means\nthat the yogî is not attracted to finding satisfaction in the\naccumulation of wealth.\nIt has been said that the desire for wealth is what makes\nthe world go round. This may be true in the sense that the\ndesire for wealth is what drives most people to act. Sadly\nwe also see clearly where greed for wealth is taking the\nworld today – political unrest culminating in war, death\nand destruction, economic instability and collapse as well\nas extreme instability in the environment. This results in\nnatural disasters and the extinction of many species of life.\nChapter 6\n163"

    "commentary": "Control of the mind is quintessential for the practice of\nyoga. The problem arises due to the very nature of the mind\nitself. The nature of the mind is flickering and unsteady; it\nwants to wander here and there from one sense-object to\nthe next. Even in sleep the wandering mind is active. But\nÇrî K®ß√a says that the yogî must always endeavour to bring\nthe mind under control of his higher conscious self. This is\nindeed the foremost challenge that a yogî faces.\nIn some western philosophical systems the mind is\nconceived of as the self, but this does not hold true in\nyoga. In yoga, the mind is called ‘the sense within’. The\nsenses of the body like sight, sound, touch, smell and taste\nare engaged with external objects and the mind acts as the\nfaculty that ultimately makes sense of sensual experiences\n– the sense within. But in yoga the self is conceived of as\na transcendental substance that exists independent of the\nmind and body. Therefore, according to the knowledge of\nyoga, the self survives the death of the body and mind. It is\nsomething completely different.\nThere are many external practices within the yoga system\nsuch as fasting and living in a secluded place that help to\nChapter 6\n167\ncontrol the mind. But owing to the nature of the mind\nbeing like the wind, these external methods frequently fall\nshort of the mark. However, in the bhakti-yoga system it is\nrecommended to control the mind by mantra. The word\nmantra originates from two Sanskrit words – mana (the\nmind) and tråyate (to control). By engaging the mind in\nthe process of hearing and chanting mantras – and espe-\ncially the mahå-mantra, the great mantra for delivering the\nmind – the wandering mind becomes steady in the self.\nThe mahå-mantra is a direct sound representation of\nthe Absolute Truth, Çrî K®ß√a. As such, the mahå-mantra\nis both all-powerful and all-attractive. The power of the\nmahå-mantra removes the ignorance that covers the real\nidentity of the living being and the all-attractive nature\nof the mahå-mantra fills the heart of the chanter with\ninconceivable ånanda, supreme spiritual bliss. Chanting of\nthe mahå-mantra to control and steady the mind has been\nhighly recommended for these reasons."

The culmination of\nknowledge is to understand Çrî K®ß√a as the underlying\nprinciple of everything. Yet some commentators on Bhaga-\nvad-gîtå have tried to explain the Gîtå minus K®ß√a. That is\nto say, they have said such things as, “K®ß√a was a tempo-\nrary manifestation of the Supreme Brahman,” “K®ß√a has\nno eternal existence as a person” or that when K®ß√a says\nthings like, “One attains My abode,” K®ß√a actually means\nthat one attains something else of an impersonal nature.\nHowever, true masters of yoga and scholars of Vedic liter-\nature reject all these ideas.\nBhagavad-gîtå, although surely mystical in that it delin-\neates in great detail the Absolute Truth and how to attain\nthat Truth, is not an allegorical or speculative treatise on\nthe subject of perfection. Bhagavad-gîtå is to be taken lit-\nerally as a conversation between Çrî K®ß√a and His dear\nfriend and devotee, Arjuna. Therein lies the open secret to\nChapter 6\n171\nunderstanding Bhagavad-gîtå. K®ß√a says what He means\nand means what He says – therefore an abstract commen-\ntary on Bhagavad-gîtå is not necessary.\nThat Çrî K®ß√a is everywhere, in all things and within\nthe hearts of all living beings is confirmed by the above\nverses. K®ß√a says that He is in all living beings as the Par-\namåtmå and all living beings are in Him as His parts and\nparcels. K®ß√a is in all things and all things are in K®ß√a.\nOne who endeavours to see in this way becomes enlight-\nened – indeed such a vision is enlightenment.\nArjuna, being a self-realised yogî and an eternal associ-\nate of K®ß√a, does not argue with K®ß√a over such conclu-\nsions. However, Arjuna does object to the rigours of yoga\nrequired to attain such perfection. Arjuna was a family man\nwith many responsibilities, so how was he to practice yoga?\nArjuna pleads his case in favour of day to day people in\nthat the yoga system of rigorous mind control described so\nfar by K®ß√a is too difficult. It is simply impractical.\nK®ß√a’s assurance to Arjuna is that if one perseveres\nthen one will certainly be successful. But understanding\nArjuna’s point, K®ß√a will indeed bring the attainment\nof the Absolute Truth into the reach of everyone as the\nBhagavad-gîtå discourse continues."

Jñåna means knowledge of self as distinguished\nfrom non-self, or knowledge that the self is not the body.\nVijñåna means realised knowledge or realisation of one’s\nintrinsic relationship with K®ß√a. Çrîmad Bhågavatam also\nmentions jñåna and vijñåna as follows:\njñånaµ parama guhyaµ me yad vijñåna-samanvitam\nsa-rahasyaµ tad a∫gaµ ca g®hå√a gaditaµ mayå\nKnowledge (jñåna) about K®ß√a as described in the\nVedic literatures is very confidential, and it has to\nbe realised (vijñåna) in conjunction with the secrets\nof devotion. (Çrîmad Bhågavatam 2.9.31)\nWhen we speak of knowledge, modern man immedi-\nately thinks of scientific knowledge which he deems to\nbe most perfect. However, jñåna in Bhagavad-gîtå refers\nto that knowledge of the self as distinguished from the\nknowledge of matter or scientific knowledge. Knowledge\nof matter is called aparå-vidyå and it is quite distinct\nfrom the knowledge of the self in that it never leads to\nself-realisation.\nSince the beginning of the Rationalist movement, some\nfive centuries ago, science has completely rejected the idea\nof consciousness as independent of matter. Many scientific\ntheories have been presented to explain the origin of the\nuniverse and the origin of life such as the ‘Big Bang’ and\nDarwinian Evolution, but these explanations remain mere\ntheories, lacking conclusive evidence.\nChapter 7\n181\nFor centuries, scientific and theistic communities have\nbeen at odds with each other, but recently it appears that\nthe two may finally be drawing closer. Leading persons in\nthe scientific community are willing to accept conscious-\nness as a scientific fact. Indeed, biologist and stem-cell\ntherapist, Dr. Robert Lanza has of late rocked the scien-\ntific world with his book, Biocentrism – How Life Creates\nthe Universe, in which he postulates that consciousness has\nevolved matter and not that matter has evolved conscious-\nness. If this current trend continues then indeed science\nmay very well be on the path of jñåna.\nThe understanding of consciousness being the origin of\nmatter has taken a long time to manifest. But as K®ß√a says in\nverse 3, those who endeavour for perfection are very rare, and\nrarer still are those who actually understand K®ß√a. To this\nend, all learned and educated people in the world should take\nlessons from Bhagavad-gîtå."

    "commentary": "The basic material elements that comprise the universe\nhave been mentioned here. Earth (bhümi), water (åpa), fire\n(anala) and air (våyu) are, for the most part, easy to com-\nprehend – whereas khaµ, the invisible element, is rather\nmore difficult. Khaµ is defined as accommodating space\nfor existence. For a long time, modern science has rejected\nthe Bhagavad-gîtå’s concept of space as an element. How-\never, once again the scientific community finds itself\nfacing serious problems wherein an elusive element must\nbe present in the universe in order for them to explain how\nthe universe works. This element, physicists say, may com-\nprise up to 80% or more of the universe, but is unknown\nto them and is thus far undetectable. They have called this\n‘Dark Matter’.\nChapter 7\n183\nThe first person to provide evidence and infer the\nexistence of the phenomenon of Dark Matter was the\nSwiss astrophysicist Fritz Zwicky, of the California Insti-\ntute of Technology in 1933. Zwicky applied the viral\ntheorem to the Coma cluster of galaxies and obtained evi-\ndence of unseen mass. Zwicky estimated the cluster’s total\nmass based on the motions of galaxies near its edge and\ncompared that estimate to one based on the number of\ngalaxies and total brightness of the cluster. He found that\nthere was about four-hundred times more estimated mass\nthan was visually observable. The gravity of the visible\ngalaxies in the cluster would be far too small for such fast\norbits, so something extra was required. This is known as\nthe ‘Missing Mass Problem’. Based on these conclusions,\nZwicky inferred that there must be some non-visible form\nof matter that would provide enough of the mass and\ngravity to hold the cluster together. That was the begin-\nning of the search for Dark Matter.\nSeventy-eight years later, science is still looking for\nDark Matter. They know it is literally everywhere, but it\nescapes detection and thus they are unable to observe it.\nMillions in taxpayers’ money is spent every year by western\nscientists in the search for Dark Matter. Nothing has yet\nbeen discovered.\nHowever, the Çrîmad Bhågavatam identifies a material\nelement that among its other qualities is, for the most part,\nelusive. It is all-pervading, but simultaneously it is unde-\ntectable. That element according to Bhågavatam is called\nnabhas, or as mentioned here in Bhagavad-gîtå, khaµ.\nThe activities, qualities and characteristics of the khaµ\nelement can be observed as accommodating space/room\n184\nBhagavad-gita\nfor existence. Space itself, both internal and external, is the\nelement khaµ. This then, if taken notice of by physicists,\nmay very well fit nicely into the ‘Missing Mass Problem’.\nKhaµ, being a material element, could theoretically be\nassigned a numerical code – then they might find what\nthey are looking for.\nIn the Vedic way of thinking, a physical element is\nsecondary to its qualities – when the qualities of a par-\nticular thing are understood, it is as good as or better than\nhaving the gross object at hand. In that sense, modern\nscience has already discovered Dark Matter, because they\nhave understood something of its qualities – they just hav-\nen’t realised it yet. In the Çrîmad Bhågavatam we find the\nfollowing verse:\nbhütånåµ chidra-dåt®tvaµ bahir antaram eva ca\nprå√endriyåtma-dhiß√yatvaµ nabhaso v®tti-lakßa√am\nThe activities and characteristics of nabhas can be\nobserved as accommodation for external and inter-\nnal existences of all living beings, namely the field\nof activities of the vital air, the senses and the mind.\n(Çrîmad Bhågavatam 3.26.34)\nThis verse is the potential basis for great scientific\nresearch work. It explains how subtle forms are generated\nfrom nabhas, what their characteristics and actions are,\nand how the tangible elements, namely air, fire, water and\nearth, are manifested from the subtle form.\nBhågavatam does not simply list the basic material ele-\nments, but explains quite scientifically how those elements\nevolve from the most subtle plane of existence up to the\nChapter 7\n185\ndivisions of the universe – this is quite elaborate and sci-\nentific indeed. Yet for science to take full advantage of this\nunderstanding of matter and to discover how the universe\ncame into being, they will have to do more than just add\nkhaµ to their table of elements – they will have to add\naha∫kåra (false ego), mana (the mind) and buddhi (intel-\nligence). For indeed, Bhagavad-gîtå lists these as material\nelements. Furthermore, these elements, aha∫kåra, mana\nand buddhi are categorised as even more subtle than khaµ,\nbecause they are closer in character to consciousness (åtmå).\nBeyond the gross and subtle material elements being\nadded to the scientific table, Bhagavad-gîtå says that a\ncomplete understanding of existence and reality is not\npossible without adding two transcendental, anti-material\nconcepts – namely åtmå and Paramåtmå (consciousness\nand Super Consciousness). This, it seems, science strug-\ngles with even more than Dark Matter. We have dubbed\nthese ‘Light Matter’.\nMind and intelligence should not be confused with the\nself or åtmå. Mind and intelligence have not arisen out of\nmatter as some philosophers or scientists have suggested.\nLast in the list is aha∫kåra or false ego. All these are mate-\nrial elements which manifest from the aparå-prak®ti or the\ninferior energy of K®ß√a. These gross and subtle elements\nmake up the material body and cover the self within.\nThose conditioned by material elements consider the\nbody as the self. But K®ß√a says that there is another energy\nof His – a superior energy, which is a conscious potency\nand consists of all living beings.\nBhagavad-gîtå clearly explains both the gross and subtle\nmaterial elements as well as consciousness and Super Con-\n186\nBhagavad-gita\nsciousness. Any theory that does not include all of these\nelements is surely inadequate."

    "commentary": "Since the most ancient times we find the same funda-\nmental questions in the search for knowledge and meaning\n– Who are we? Where did we come from? Why are we\nhere? How should we conduct ourselves? Is there life after\ndeath? These were questions in the minds of our ancestors\nand we still ask the same questions today. The search for\nanswers to these questions leads an intelligent person to\nconclude that consciousness is superior to matter and that\nthere must be one absolute source from which everything\nin the universe and beyond emanates.\nHere Çrî K®ß√a says that He is the singular cause of\neverything and that nothing is superior to Him. He is\nthe sum total of the universe and of all living creatures,\nbut He Himself remains separate from everything as the\nSupreme Individual.\nThroughout the yoga systems we find that the chant-\ning of mantras is highly recommended and possibly no\nmantra is chanted more than oµ, or oµkåra. This oµkåra is\ndescribed as the supreme combination of letters (a, u and\nµ) and is thus the primary Vedic mantra. Here Çrî K®ß√a\nChapter 7\n189\nsays that He is the oµ found in Vedic mantras and as such,\nit is K®ß√a that is to be meditated on while chanting oµ. In\nsupport of this the ‰g Veda states as follows:\noµ ity etad brahma√o nediß†aµ\nnåma yasmåd uccåryamåna\neva saµsåra-bhayåt tårayati\ntasmåd-ucyate tåra iti\noµ åsya jånanto nåma cid-viviktan mahaste viß√o\nsumatiµ bhajåmahe oµ tat sat\ntato ‘bhüt triv®d-oµkåro yo ‘vyakta prabhava˙ svarå†\nyat tal-li∫gaµ bhagavato brahma√a˙ paramåtmana˙\nOne who chants oµ, which is the closest form of\nBrahman, approaches Brahman. This liberates one\nfrom the fear of the material world; therefore, it is\nknown as tåraka-brahman. O Viß√u/K®ß√a, Your\nself-manifested name, oµ, is the eternal form of\ncognisance. Even if my knowledge about the glo-\nries of reciting this name is incomplete, still, by the\npractice of reciting this name, I will achieve perfect\nknowledge. He who has unmanifested potencies and\nis fully independent manifests the vibration oµkåra,\nwhich indicates Himself. Brahman, Paramåtmå and\nBhagavån are the three forms He manifests. (Dh®ta\n‰g Veda 1.156.3)\nNow the question may arise that if oµ is non-differ-\nent from Çrî K®ß√a, what then is the necessity to chant\nthe mahå-mantra? Great åcåryas such as Jîva Gosvåmî,\nViçvanåtha Cakravartî, Bhaktivinoda, Sarasvatî ˇhåkura,\nSvåmî B.R. Çrîdhara, Bhaktivedånta Svåmî Prabhupåda and\n190\nBhagavad-gita\nothers are all in agreement that oµ helps us up to the stage\nof liberation from material bondage. But the benefits of\nchanting the mahå-mantra continue even after liberation,\nhelping us to develop spontaneous affection for K®ß√a and\nthus cultivate our eternal relationship with Him.\nIn the ontology of mantras it is said that oµ ema-\nnates from the flute of Çrî K®ß√a; it then manifests as\ngåyatrî-mantra, then as the Vedas, Vedånta and Çrîmad\nBhågavatam. The last verse of Bhågavatam recommends the\nchanting of the mahå-mantra.\nnåma-sa∫kîrtanaµ yasya sarva-påpa-pra√åçanam\npra√åmo du˙kha-çamanas taµ namåmi hariµ param\nThe chanting of the mahå-mantra can relieve us from\nall undesirable habits, all filthy characteristics and\nall miseries. Chant the mahå-mantra! Nothing else\nis necessary. Take this! Chant the mahå-mantra and\nbegin your real life in this dark age of Kali-yuga with\nthe most broad and wide theistic conception. Let\nus all bow down to Çrî K®ß√a. (Çrîmad Bhågavatam\n12.13.23)\nOne may chant oµ and certainly everyone should chant\nthe mahå-mantra. Those who do this under the guidance\nof the spiritual master will certainly taste the fruits of\nself-realisation."

These qualities are mentioned in Caitan-\nya-caritåm®ta as follows:\nk®pålu, ak®ta-droha, satya-såra sama\nnidoßa, vadånya, m®du, çuci, akiñcana\nsarvopakåraka, çånta, k®ß√aika-çara√a\nakåma, anîha, sthira, vijita-ßa∂-gu√a\nmita-bhuk, apramatta, månada, amånî\ngambhîra, karu√a, maitra, kavi, dakßa, maunî\nDevotees of Çrî K®ß√a are always merciful, humble,\ntruthful, and equal to all, faultless, magnanimous,\nmild and clean. They are without material posses-\nsions, and they perform welfare work for everyone.\nThey are peaceful, surrendered to K®ß√a and without\ndesire. They are indifferent to material acquisitions\n196\nBhagavad-gita\nand are fixed in devotion to K®ß√a. They completely\ncontrol the six bad qualities – lust, anger, greed and\nso forth. They eat only as much as required, and\nthey are not intoxicated with false ego. They are\nrespectful, grave, compassionate and without false\nprestige. They are friendly, poetic, expert and silent.\n(Caitanya-caritåm®ta, Madhya-lîlå, 22. 78-80)\nThe popularity of the bhakti movement in contempo-\nrary times has also come to include the worship of many\ndemigods and demigoddesses such as Çiva, Ga√eça, Sar-\nasvatî, Lakßmî etc. However, according to Bhagavad-gîtå,\nthe worship of various demigods is not on the same level\nas worshipping K®ß√a and thus does not help one advance\nin self-realisation. Bhakti-yoga is solely meant for K®ß√a.\nBhakti is the reciprocal exchange between K®ß√a and His\ndevotees and thus bhakti is incompatible with the worship\nof the demigods.\nIt is not that the demigods are ‘false gods,’ but they\nsimply cannot free one from material bondage. K®ß√a\nknows what is necessary for the ultimate good of all living\ncreatures and therefore He says that worship of demigods\nis less intelligent.\nIt can also be said that those who worship the demi-\ngods worship K®ß√a indirectly, because the demigods are\nthe representatives of K®ß√a for the management of uni-\nversal affairs. In that way the worship of demigods is also\nthe worship of K®ß√a, save and except for the fruits of\nliberation. Only K®ß√a is known as mukti-pada, the giver\nof liberation, or Mukunda. Speaking in Padma Purå√a,\nÇiva says:\nChapter 7\n197\nmukti-pradåtå sarveßåµ viß√ur eva na saµçaya˙\nUndoubtedly, Viß√u (K®ß√a) is the only deliverer of\nliberation for all. (Padma Purå√a 6.253.176)\nWhen surrender to K®ß√a is the only shelter from the\ncycle of birth and death, then it stands to reason that one\nshould take shelter of K®ß√a and forego the worship of\nvarious demigods."

    "commentary": "Çrî K®ß√a’s answers to Arjuna are to the point and if one\naccepts K®ß√a as the ultimate authority in yoga, as indeed\nHe is, then one quickly attains the most valuable knowl-\nedge. To acquire perfect knowledge by speculation or by\nthe process of trial and error simply wastes valuable time.\nIn fact, so much time is wasted in speculation and exper-\nimentation that even after centuries such processes have\nfailed to deliver perfect knowledge of the meaning of life.\nEveryone is dying, and for the most part dying without\nanswers to life’s most basic questions. However, since time\nimmemorial, Çrî K®ß√a has had the answers and they are\npresented here in Bhagavad-gîtå.\nK®ß√a says that all living beings are Brahman – part and\nparcel of the spiritual energy of the Absolute Truth – eter-\nnal, individual, imperishable and immutable. However, in\nthis material world death of the body comes to everyone.\nThere are no exceptions. But for those whose mind and\nintelligence are fixed on K®ß√a, they do not take birth\nagain in the material world, but attain K®ß√a’s own divine\nnature. K®ß√a is by nature sac-cid-ånanda – eternal, com-\nplete in knowledge and full of bliss. Remembering K®ß√a\nat the time of death, one attains that nature and is imme-\ndiately transferred to the abode of K®ß√a, far beyond the\nmaterial sky and the planets of birth and death. As K®ß√a\nwill explain in Chapter 15, one who attains His Supreme\nAbode does not return to this material world.\nWhen we speak of saµsåra, we are indeed talking about\nreincarnation. Although reincarnation is becoming a pop-\nular belief in many communities, it is for the most part\nmisunderstood. To many, reincarnation means being born\nChapter 8\n207\nas a human being life after life, but this is not a fact. The\nhuman form of life is only rarely achieved. It is not some-\nthing that comes in rapid succession. Above and below the\nhuman species there are hundreds and thousands of other\nlife forms. According to one’s activities performed in this\nlife and one’s final consciousness and state of mind at the\ntime of death, one‘s next birth is determined.\nIn the species below the human being, namely animal,\naquatic, insect and plant life, there is great ignorance and\nsuffering. Above the human plane there are higher planets\nfull of celestial beings and celestial pleasures. Yet higher or\nlower, all stations of life in the material world are tempo-\nrary. There is no place of eternal damnation and no place\nof eternal happiness in the material universe. Nothing\nin this world is everlasting. Only the abode of K®ß√a is\nbeyond the dualities of pleasure and suffering.\nK®ß√a says above in verse 5, anta-kåle ca måm eva\nsmaran muktvå kalevaram – one who remembers Him at\nthe time of death attains His transcendental nature. To\nremember K®ß√a at the end of life is indeed perfection, and\nto forget Him is the greatest aberration. The Viß√u-dhar-\nmottara Purå√a states:\nså hånis tan mahac-chidraµ sa moha˙ sa ca vibhrama˙\nyan muhürtaµ kßa√aµ våpi våsudevo na cintayet\nIf even for a moment remembrance of K®ß√a is\nmissed, that is the greatest loss, the greatest illu-\nsion and the greatest anomaly. (Viß√u-dharmottara\nPurå√a 1.16)\n208\nBhagavad-gita\nHowever, it is our experience of the world that death\nis often accompanied by great pain, confusion and bewil-\nderment of memory. Therefore, it would seem that to\nremember K®ß√a at the time of death is no easy task. Death\nmay come swiftly at any time, without a moments notice\nor even during sleep, thus impeding one’s remembrance of\nK®ß√a. In this regard Kulaçekhara Ålvår writes in Mukun-\nda-målå Stotram as follows:\nk®ß√a tvadîya-pada-pa∫kaja-pañjaråntam\nadyaiva me viçatu månasa-råja-haµsa˙\nprå√a-prayå√a-samaye kapha-våta-pittai˙\nka√†håvarodhana-vidhau smara√aµ kutas te\nO K®ß√a, please help me die quickly so the swan\nof my mind may become encircled by the stem of\nYour lotus feet. Otherwise at the time of my final\nbreath, when my throat is choked up, how will it be\npossible for me to think of You? (Mukunda-målå\nStotram 33)\nFor the bhakti-yogî K®ß√a takes all his many endeavours,\npractices and services into consideration. Even if the bhak-\nti-yogî is unable to remember K®ß√a at the time of death,\nK®ß√a will certainly remember him. Çrî K®ß√a is never for-\ngetful under any circumstance and thus He swiftly delivers\nHis devotee from the clutches of death. K®ß√a Himself\nconfirms this in the Varåha Purå√a as follows:\nyadi vitådi-doße√a mad bhakto måµ ca na smaret\nahaµ smaråmi mad bhakta˙ nayåmi paramåµ gatim\nChapter 8\n209\nIf My devotee is unable to remember Me at the time\nof death because of the great disturbances felt within\nthe body, at that time I shall remember My devotee\nand take him to the spiritual world."

    "commentary": "Yoga and meditation are described herein. However,\nthey are not impersonal or self-centred processes. Medita-\ntion is to be performed on the Absolute Truth, Çrî K®ß√a –\nnot on abstract ideas that we ourselves are the sum total of\nreality, that we are all-knowing or that we are the supreme\ncontroller etc. Such processes are not meditation, but\nself-deception and never lead to liberation or eternal bliss.\nIn verse 10, Çrî K®ß√a says that in yogic meditations\n(aß†å√ga and ku√∂alinî-yoga) one should draw one’s life-\nairs to the area of the eyebrows. This indicates the location\nof the åjñå-cakra. There are seven cakras located in the\nbody that are the primary seats of human consciousness.\nConsciousness pervades the entire body, but is said to\nbe centred in one of the seven cakras – mülådhåra-cakra\n(located at the base of the genital), svådhiß†håna-cakra\n(located at the base of the spinal cord), ma√ipüra-cakra\n(located in the navel area), anåhata-cakra (located in the\nheart), viçuddha-cakra (located in the throat), åjñå-cakra\n(located in between the eyebrows) and the sahasråra-cakra\n(located at the top of the head).\nChapter 8\n211\nWhen consciousness is situated in the lower three cakras\none is found to be preoccupied with the animal tendencies\nof eating, sleeping, mating and defending. When con-\nsciousness is situated in the upper cakras there is progress\nin the finer sentiments of spiritual culture and ultimately\nliberation. Consciousness is raised in meditation from one\ncakra to another through the subtle passage in the body\nknown as the sußum√å-nå∂î.\nK®ß√a says that the yogî should bring his consciousness\nto be seated in the åjñå-cakra, sometimes known as the\n‘third eye’. Here the yogî makes his or her final preparation\nand at last raises the consciousness through the sußum√å-\nnå∂î to the sahasråra-cakra and from there the yogî quits the\nmaterial body. If the aß†å∫ga-yogî or ku√∂alinî-yogî makes\nÇrî K®ß√a the object of his meditation while concentrating\non the åjñå-cakra, then after passing the sahasråra-cakra,\nthe yogî achieves K®ß√a’s Supreme Abode. However, if the\nsaid yogî does not make Çrî K®ß√a the object of his medita-\ntion, then he may enter the brahma-jyoti for sometime, but\neventually he returns to this material world.\nThe aforementioned processes of yoga take superhu-\nman endeavour and for the most part are not possible for\nthe average person to achieve in this age. Aß†å∫ga-yoga\nand ku√∂alinî-yoga must be practiced in absolute seclu-\nsion from society, observing complete celibacy and fasting\nfor long periods. In ancient times such yogîs went to the\nmountain caves of the Himålayas or to the deserts. Today’s\nyogîs in modern yoga studios and societies are unable to\nraise their consciousness through the cakras to the sahas-\nråra-cakra because they lack the solitude and severe deter-\nmination required. Therefore, Bhagavad-gîtå conclusively\n212\nBhagavad-gita\nrecommends the process of bhakti-yoga that can be prac-\nticed by everyone, everywhere, by fixing the mind on Çrî\nK®ß√a and thus attaining perfection.\nOne may question that since Çrî K®ß√a is speaking here\nin the third person that He is not referring to Himself as\nthe object of meditation and therefore it does not mean\nthat we should meditate on K®ß√a. However, according to\nSvåmî B. R. Çrîdhara Mahåråja, a great åcårya of bhakti-yoga,\nwhen K®ß√a speaks in the third person, He is referring to\nthe object of meditation as His expansion as Paramåtmå\n(Super Consciousness). As already explained in the Second\nChapter, Çrî K®ß√a manifests Himself as the Paramåtmå,\npresent in the hearts of all living beings. Therefore, medi-\ntation on the Paramåtmå means meditation on K®ß√a.\nThose who cannot comprehend the Absolute Truth\nas personal, due to anarthas (misgivings of the heart), can\nmeditate on K®ß√a’s impersonal aspect as Brahman. But\nthis process is tedious and the results are limited since even\nthe Brahman-realised yogî must once again return to the\nworld of birth and death."

The process of yoga is intended for\none goal and one goal alone – to transcend the world\nof birth and death. There is, of course, more than one\nsystem of yoga, but all schools of yoga aim at a singular\ngoal – liberation.\nAs already explained in previous commentaries, the\nmantra oµ elevates one to the stage of liberation. However,\nit should be noted here that the divisions of yoga, such as\nsense-control and celibacy, must also be in place before\nthe chanting of mantras can be effective. Mantras purify\nthe mind and heart of material contamination which arises\nfrom sense enjoyment. If one endeavours for purification,\nbut at the same time does not control the senses, then it is\ntantamount to starting a fire while simultaneously pouring\nwater on it. Sense-control is therefore essential for those\nattempting to practice all forms of yoga.\nChapter 8\n215"

Life on that planet is very\nlong – one day in Satya-loka is equal to 4,260,000,000\nyears on planet Earth. Nonetheless death occurs there also.\nNowhere in the material universe is free from death.\nAt the end of each of Brahmå’s days there is a partial\nannihilation in the universe and a total annihilation of the\nuniverse at the end of Brahmå’s life. The partial annihila-\ntions are called pralaya and the final annihilation is called\nmahå-pralaya. Everything in the universe has a beginning\nand an end. All things come into being and eventually\nall things are destroyed. Creation, duration and annihila-\ntion are the three basic phases of the universe, yet Bhaga-\nvad-gîtå does not subscribe to an apocalyptic world view\nor an ‘end times’ scenario in which we will all be judged.\nThe predominating Deities of creation, duration and\nannihilation are the three gu√åvatåras, Brahmå, Mahå-\nViß√u and Çiva respectively. Brahmå manifests the second-\nary creation, Mahå-Viß√u maintains the creation and Çiva,\nby producing a sound vibration from his ∂amaru drum,\nbrings about the annihilation. These gu√åvatåras are por-\ntions of the plenary expansions of K®ß√a, the avatårî, or\norigin of all avatåras. During the periods of annihilation,\nboth partial and complete, the living beings rest in a state\n218\nBhagavad-gita\nof slumber within the body of Mahå-Viß√u and are again\nmanifest at the arrival of Brahmå’s day. This is repeated\nover and over again on a cosmic timescale until Brahmå\nreaches the end of his life, at which point the entire universe\nis again wound up in the body of Mahå-Viß√u. Everything\nnecessary for the manifestation of the material universe,\nand indeed billions and trillions of universes, is provided\nby Mahå-Viß√u in the form of the mahat-tattva (the aggre-\ngate of material elements), and at the time of annihilation\nthat energy is again absorbed into Mahå-Viß√u.\nEnergy is neither created or destroyed as it exists\nalways as K®ß√a’s aparå-prak®ti, inferior material energy.\nThat energy is endlessly mutable, manifest and unman-\nifest, but ultimately it is never destroyed. K®ß√a and all\nHis energies are eternal.\nOnce again, the same point is being reiterated by\nK®ß√a, that His Supreme Abode is beyond material\nnature, eternally manifest, beyond birth and death and\nonce going there one does not return to saµsåra. That\nSupreme Abode of K®ß√a is Goloka V®ndåvana, and it is\nattainable only through the process of bhakti-yoga. This\nSupreme Abode is mentioned in B®had-bhågavatåm®ta as\nfollows:\ngoloka-nåmopari sarva-sîma-go\nvaiku√†hato deça-viçeßa-çekhara˙\nsa ca tad vraja-lokånåµ çrîmat-premånuvartinå\nk®ß√e çuddhatare√aiva bhåvenaikena labhyate\nFar from this material universe is the beautiful abode\nof Çrî K®ß√a that is known as Goloka V®ndåvana,\nthe topmost Vaiku√†ha planet.

This has already been mentioned in\nprevious chapters, but now K®ß√a will make it definitive.\nÇrî K®ß√a is the Absolute Truth, the Cause of creation,\nthe origin of all living beings, the Controller, the object of\nknowledge, the mantra oµ and so forth. One who knows\nthis in his heart of hearts and lives solely by such a creed\nwill surely attain K®ß√a. This is the positive incentive. The\nnegative incentive is also explained by K®ß√a that those\nwho are not fixed in Him will be reborn in the cycle of\nbirth and death.\nIn verse 3 K®ß√a uses the word açraddadhånå˙. Çrad-\ndhå means ‘faith’ and açraddhå means ‘without faith’. This\ndescribes those who do not have the resolute determina-\ntion to perform bhakti-yoga. Of such persons K®ß√a says\nthat they will continue in the cycle of saµsåra. That is\nnot to say that they are damned to some eternal hell, but\nsimply put, they cannot attain the platform of liberation.\nFirst it is important to understand that çraddhå is not\nto be confused with the belief or mundane faith that is\nusually associated with a particular religion such as Juda-\nism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism or Hinduism. Christian\nfaith, Muslim faith, Hindu faith etc. implies a belief in\na particular set of moral ideals, myths, superstitions and\ndogmas, but çraddhå is something entirely different.\nChapter 9\n227\nÇrat dadhåti iti çraddhå˙ – ‘That which leads to truth\nand self-realisation is known as çraddhå.’ Çraddhå is devel-\noped by association with saintly persons who are self-real-\nised and free from the contamination of material nature. In\nsuch association the conviction develops that by surrender\nand taking shelter of K®ß√a all other purposes are served.\nWithout such çraddhå and fixed determination, one cannot\nfollow the path of bhakti-yoga."

At a glance this sounds like a good definition\nof karma, but karma is much more complicated than that.\nThe saying, ‘an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth’\nalso does not accurately define the laws of action and reac-\ntion. Karma is far more intricate and complicated than a\nsimple one on one analogy can provide. Suffice to say that\nwhen one performs an action he is held responsible and\nthus liable for the reaction, whatever that may be. Material\nnature may therefore be considered superior to the energy\nof the living beings, in that the living beings have no con-\ntrol over material nature. People are expert in exploiting\n230\nBhagavad-gita\nnature, yet they cannot control the adverse reactions that\nresult from it. Çrî K®ß√a, on the other hand, does not incur\nkarma or a reaction when He acts because material nature\nis always under His control – îçvara˙ parama˙ k®ß√a˙."

Yet atheism\nin modern times seems driven more as a reaction to fanat-\nical religious dogma than by rational argument. Indeed,\noften times the arguments of the atheist are as irrational as\nthose of religious fanatics. When presented with an intel-\nligent proposal, a rationalist should be willing to accept\nit, regardless of where that proposal leads, even if it leads\nto undermine his atheistic world view. Such would be the\nmentality of a real seeker of truth or science.\nFor the most part, in the modern arena of debate between\ntheists and atheists, the student of Bhagavad-gîtå would not\nside with either because both are predominately ignorant of\nhigher knowledge. Coming in contact with Bhagavad-gîtå,\nboth the atheists and religious fanatics are silenced because\nwithin the Gîtå lies the most definitive knowledge of the\nAbsolute Truth ever revealed to the world."

In\nancient times, some 10,000 years ago, soma was a celestial\nelixir taken by the performers of certain Vedic rituals that\nwas meant to elevate one to higher planets. Soma was not\n236\nBhagavad-gita\nsimply an intoxicant, as some readers of the Bhagavad-gîtå\nhave surmised. Only those fully conversant in the three\nVedas who were expert in performing Vedic rituals were\nallowed to drink soma. Due to the passage of time, we do\nnot know exactly how soma was made, but we do know\nthat it was an elixir and not simply an intoxicant like wine,\nwhisky or gañjå.\nThose who are conversant in the Vedas reach the higher\nplanets and enjoy celestial pleasures. K®ß√a says that when\ntheir pious credit is exhausted, they again enter the mortal\nplane of Earth. Therefore, the understanding is that all\nendeavours for material pleasure are temporary, even those\nexperienced in higher planets.\nBut for the bhakti-yogî there is no need to perform com-\nplicated and costly Vedic rituals because all the purposes\nof such ceremonies are fulfilled by acts of devotion and\nsurrender to K®ß√a. The intimacy of the bhakti-yogîs with\nK®ß√a is such that He proclaims that He carries what they\nlack and preserves what they have. This is the extension of\nK®ß√a’s shelter (åçraya), for those who surrender to Him.\nThis theme is repeated throughout the Bhagavad-gîtå."

But\nbecause they do not recognise K®ß√a as the proprietor and\nenjoyer of all things, they eventually fall down from their\nposition of false renunciation. We say ‘false renunciation’\nbecause real renunciation means to renounce the idea of\noneself being the proprietor and enjoyer and to recognise\nK®ß√a as the proprietor and the enjoyer of everything.\nIn the stage of real renunciation, one offers everything\nfirst to K®ß√a and accepts only the remnants of such offer-\nings for his maintenance. The process of offering food to\nK®ß√a by chanting appropriate mantras is to be learned\nfrom the guru. When food is offered to K®ß√a by mantra\nthe food becomes ‘K®ß√anised’. This is called prasådam, or\nK®ß√a’s mercy.\nÇrî K®ß√a says that if one offers Him with devotion\na leaf, flowers, fruits or some water He will accept that.\nChapter 9\n239\nThis means that non-vegetarian foodstuff such as meat,\nfish and eggs, as well as preparations containing such\nthings are not offerable to K®ß√a. Food offerable to K®ß√a\nincludes vegetables, fruits, nuts, grains and milk products.\nIt should be noted that being Gopåla, the protector of the\ncows, K®ß√a is very fond of milk products such as yogurt,\nbutter etc. A diet of such food offered to K®ß√a will make\none healthy and fit for the practice of yoga as well as free\nfrom karmic reactions."

Though\nK®ß√a is their origin, not even the demigods and the great\nsages such as Brahmå, Indra, Sanaka, Durvåså, Marîci and\nothers know K®ß√a as He is. But one who is K®ß√a’s dev-\notee, the bhakti-yogî, knows K®ß√a as the Supreme Person\nsituated in the core of his heart.\nsa vai puµsåµ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokßaje\nahaituky-apratihatå yayåtmå suprasîdati\nThe topmost dharma for mankind is that by which\nthey can attain devotion unto the Supreme Person,\nwho is adhokßaja and who cannot be known by the\nmaterial senses. Such bhakti-yoga must be unmo-\ntivated and uninterrupted to fully satisfy the self.\n(Çrîmad Bhågavatam 1.2.6)\nK®ß√a gives birth to creation and to all things, but He\nHimself is without birth. Still, when K®ß√a appears on\nEarth, as He did some 5,000 years ago to speak Bhaga-\nvad-gîtå, He accepts His devotees Vasudeva and Devakî\nas His parents and appears as the sun seems to manifest\nfrom the ocean at the beginning of each day. K®ß√a first\nrevealed Himself in the heart of Vasudeva and then trans-\nferred Himself to the heart of Devakî. From there He\nappeared from her heart into the world. It is inconceivable,\nbut K®ß√a appears in the world without taking birth.\nChapter 10\n247\nThe great Bhagavad-gîtå commentator Çrî Viçvanåtha\nCakravartî says that the power of K®ß√a to be eternally\nunborn and at the same time take birth is due to K®ß√a’s\ninconceivable energy (acintya-çakti). If K®ß√a were not\ninconceivable (acintya) then He would not be the Supreme\nPerson. Viçvanåtha confirms that one who understands\nthis is never bewildered and is free from all karma."

    "commentary": "Verses eight to eleven of this chapter are said to con-\ntain the ontological substance of Bhagavad-gîtå. Herein,\nÇrî K®ß√a establishes Himself as the source of the mate-\nrial and spiritual worlds, and the origin of Brahman and\nParamåtmå. By the use of the word sarvasya, meaning\n‘everything’, He also establishes Himself as the origin of\nNåråya√a in Vaiku√†ha (the Master of all potencies).\nIn the pantheon of demigods we find that Brahmå\nis master of Satya-loka, Çiva is the master of Çiva-loka,\nIndra the master of Indra-loka, but nowhere do we find\nChapter 10\n251\nit said that anyone is master and origin of everyone and\neverything except Çrî K®ß√a. The understanding that K®ß√a\nis sarvasya compels the wise to worship K®ß√a in love with\nall their hearts.\nK®ß√a says, mac-cittå – always think of Me and med-\nitate on Me; mad-gata-prå√å – dedicate your life to Me.\nIn association with the wise engage in discussions about\nMe (kathayanta), enlivening and enlightening each other\n(bodhayanta). This is the proper way of meditation and\nengagement for the mind and senses.\nDiscussing about K®ß√a is called k®ß√a-kathå, or çrava√a\nand kîrtana – hearing and chanting. This means to hear and\nchant Bhagavad-gîtå, Çrîmad Bhågavatam and other such\nliterature and to perform sa∫kîrtana, the congregational\nchanting of the mahå-mantra:\nhare k®ß√a hare k®ß√a k®ß√a k®ß√a hare hare\nhare råma hare råma råma råma hare hare\nThis hearing and chanting of the name and activities\nof K®ß√a constitutes the topmost system of yoga. K®ß√a\nverifies in the Padma Purå√a that He resides wherever His\nname is chanted:\nnåhaµ tiß†håmi vaiku√†he yoginåµ h®dayeßu vå\ntatra tiß†håmi nårada yatra gåyanti mad bhaktå˙\nI do not reside in Vaiku√†ha, nor in the hearts of\nthe lesser yogîs. I remain where My devotees engage\nin glorifying My activities and chanting My name.\n(Padma Purå√a)\n252\nBhagavad-gita\nAltogether, there are nine processes in bhakti-yoga to\nfully engage oneself in devotion to K®ß√a. Of these, hearing\nand chanting are the first and foremost:\nçrava√aµ kîrtanaµ viß√o˙ smara√aµ påda-sevanam\narcanaµ vandanaµ dåsyaµ sakhyam åtma-nivedanam\niti puµsårpitå viß√au bhaktiç cen nava-lakßanå\nHearing and chanting the mahå-mantra and the\nactivities of Viß√u or K®ß√a, remembering Him,\nserving His lotus feet, offering Him respectful wor-\nship, offering prayers to Him, becoming His servant,\nconsidering Him as one’s dearest friend, and surren-\ndering everything to Him. These nine processes are\naccepted as bhakti-yoga. (Çrîmad Bhågavatam 7.5.23)\nIn verse 10 we find the word prîti-pürvakam. Prîti\nmeans love, but this love should not be confused with the\nlove and affections of this material world which are shared\nbetween conditioned living beings. Prîti is the state of pure\naffection wherein no expression of selfishness or mundane\nlust can be found. Such love is the requirement for wor-\nshipping K®ß√a and such love is the key to an eternal bond\nwith Him. Those who have attained such love for K®ß√a by\nbhakti-yoga are continuously empowered by Him with the\ninspiration of pure devotion (buddhi-yoga), by which they\nmay come to Him.\nK®ß√a dwells in the hearts of all living beings as the\nParamåtmå, the Super Consciousness, and directs the wan-\nderings of everyone. When one desires to know K®ß√a, to\nserve K®ß√a and to enter into an eternal relationship with\nHim, then out of compassion for them, K®ß√a personally\nChapter 10\n253\nmanifests in their hearts and destroys with the shining\nlamp of knowledge the darkness born of ignorance. It is\nsaid that K®ß√a is light and ignorance is darkness:\nk®ß√a-sürya-sama måyå haya andhakåra\nyåhå∫ k®ß√a tåhå∫ nåhi måyåra adhikåra\nK®ß√a is compared to the sun and måyå (ignorance)\nis like the darkness. Wherever there is K®ß√a there\ncan never be any darkness. (Caitanya-caritåm®ta,\nMadhya-lîlå 22.31)\nWherever light appears darkness is vanquished. Thus,\nwhen K®ß√a personally appears in the heart of the bhak-\nti-yogî, all darkness and despair vanish and one is supremely\nenlightened. This is the quintessence of Bhagavad-gîtå."

But in order that future generations may not\nmistake K®ß√a for an ordinary man or simply a philoso-\npher, Arjuna requests K®ß√a to reveal His universal form\n(viçvarüpa) – the form of K®ß√a wherein everything in the\nuniverse is contained. This form cannot be seen by any\nindependent endeavour, but completely depends on the\nmercy of K®ß√a for Arjuna to behold.\nArjuna also knows that in the future unscrupulous men\nwill claim to be God and mislead ignorant people. There-\nfore, Arjuna wants K®ß√a to show His universal form as the\nbenchmark so that anyone claiming to be God should be\nable to show the universal form to confirm their position.\nIndeed, Arjuna’s foresight was accurate. Since the time\nof K®ß√a, and especially in modern times, many so-called\n‘godmen’ have stepped forward in society and claimed to\nbe K®ß√a or God incarnate. Unfortunately, the masses of\npeople are so ignorant that they accept such impostors.\nThe greatest misfortune befalls a person when he or she\nChapter 11\n271\nclaims to be God, or when a person accepts another human\nas God. This is without a doubt the darkest ignorance. The\nˆçopanißad warns of this as follows:\nandhaµ tama˙ praviçanti ye’vidyåm upåsate\ntato bhüya iva te tamo ya u vidyåyåµ ratå˙\nThose who engage in the worship of false things\nenter into the darkest region of ignorance. But those\nwho have knowledge, yet do not correct others, enter\ninto even darker regions. (ˆçopanißad 9)\nÇrî K®ß√a is addressed by Arjuna as the Supreme\nPerson (Parameçvara), and the Master of all yogic powers\n(Yogeçvara) because Arjuna knows that K®ß√a will be able\nto show him the universal form, thus distinguishing K®ß√a\nonce and for all as the Supreme Being."

    "commentary": "The universal form of Çrî K®ß√a is one that invokes\ngreat awe, reverence and laudations from the beholder,\nbut factually speaking, a devotee of K®ß√a is not charmed\nby such a display. Awe and reverence borders on fear and\nas we shall see, Arjuna does indeed become fearful as he\ncontinues to behold K®ß√a’s universal form. Fear does not\nencourage a loving relationship with the Supreme. There-\nfore, the universal form of K®ß√a is not very important for\nstudents of bhakti-yoga, only in as much as it proves to\ndemonstrate that unless one can show the universal form,\none should not be accepted as God.\nFactually, there are different avatåras of K®ß√a that\nappear in the universe at scheduled times and these have\nbeen mentioned by Jayadeva Gosvåmî as follows:\nvedån uddharate jaganti vahate bhü-golam udbibhrate\ndaityaµ dårayate baliµ chalayate kßatra-kßayaµ kurvate\n278\nBhagavad-gita\npaulastyaµ jayate halaµ kalayate kåru√yam åtanvate\nmlecchån mürchayate daçåk®ti-k®te k®ß√åya tubhyaµ nama˙\nO K®ß√a, I offer my respects unto You, who appear\nin the forms of these ten avatåras. As Matsya You\nrescue the Vedas, and as Kürma You carry the Man-\ndara Mountain on Your back. As Varåha You lift up\nthe Earth planet with Your tusks, and as Narasiµha\nYou tear open the chest of the daitya, Hira√yakaçipu.\nIn the form of Våmana You delude the daitya king\nBali by requesting only three steps of land from him,\nand then You take the whole universe from him by\nexpanding Your strides. As Paraçuråma You slay all\nthe wicked warriors, and as Råmacandra You fight\nthe råkßasa king Råva√a. As Balaråma You carry a\nplough with which You subdue the wicked and You\ndraw the River Yamunå towards You. As Buddha\nYou show compassion towards all the living beings\nthat are suffering in this world, and at the end of the\nKali-yuga You appear as Kalki in order to bewilder\nthe mlecchas. (Gîtå Govinda 1.12)\nIn reading the Bhagavad-gîtå one sees repetition in many\nplaces. This however is not a flaw but an embellishment\ndue to ecstasy. The åcårya Baladeva Vidyåbhüßa√a con-\nfirms this (prasåde vismaye harße dvi-trîr-uktaµ na dußyati)\nas does the famous commentator on Bhagavad-gîtå A.C.\nBhaktivedånta Svåmî Prabhupåda, who writes in his pur-\nport to verse nineteen as follows:\nThere is no limit to the extent of the six opulences\nof the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Here and in\nChapter 11\n279\nmany other places there is repetition, but according\nto the scriptures, repetition of the glories of K®ß√a is\nnot a literary weakness. It is said that at a time of\nbewilderment or wonder or of great ecstasy, statements\nare repeated over and over. That is not a flaw."

Therefore, we can understand from Arjuna’s\nsituation that the great power, opulence, majesty, devasta-\ntion and utter horror seen by him does not serve to draw\nus closer to the Absolute Truth.\nNature worship is not included in bhakti-yoga. The\nTruth is present in nature, but one must know what that\nTruth is beforehand. One cannot achieve self-realisation\n284\nBhagavad-gita\nsimply by contemplation on, or simple appreciation of\nnature alone. Meditation on the Absolute Truth is not\nimpersonal or abstract as previously mentioned. The per-\nsonal form of K®ß√a as a charming youth with a threefold\nbending form as Çyåmasundara, adorned with forest flow-\ners, dressed in bright yellow garments, while playing His\nflute under a tree on the banks of the River Yamunå is the\nmost cherished object of meditation for all great sages and\nyogîs.

He is adorned\nwith earrings that resemble two rising suns, and His\nperspiration-anointed cheeks are like two glistening\nmirrors. His eyes with raised eyebrows above them\nplayfully glance at His beloved’s face. The tip of His\ngraceful raised nose is decorated with a glistening\npearl. His lips are red like the bimba fruit and are\nsplendid in the moonlight of His teeth. His hands\nare splendid with bracelets, armlets, and jewelled\nrings. He holds a flute in His left lotus hand, His\nwaist is splendid with a graceful belt and His feet are\nsplendid with beautiful anklets. His eyes are rest-\nless with the nectar of His divine activities and He\njokes with His friends, making them laugh again and\nagain. He sits on a jewelled throne under a desire\ntree in the forest of V®ndåvana with His beloved.\nIn this way one should meditate on Çrî K®ß√a. (San-\nat-kumåra Saµhitå 54-62)\n286\nBhagavad-gita"

(Mahåbhårata, Vana-parva 313.118)\nIn 1945 when the first atomic bomb was detonated\nat test facilities in New Mexico, atomic physicist Robert\n288\nBhagavad-gita\nOppenheimer remembered verse 32 of this chapter as a just\nassessment of the moment. Years later, when asked about\nhis feelings concerning the bomb, he made the following\nstatement:\nWe knew the world would not be the same. A few people\nlaughed, a few people cried, most people were silent.\nI remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the\nBhagavad-gîtå. Viß√u is trying to persuade the Prince\n(Arjuna) that he should do his duty and to impress him\ntakes on his multi-armed form and says, “Now I am\nDeath, the destroyer of the worlds.”\nIndeed, from then till now, the world seems to hang by\na thread and our imminent destruction (seemingly at our\nown hands) could come at any moment.

    "commentary": "Up to this point in Bhagavad-gîtå, Çrî K®ß√a has\nexplained His personal, impersonal and universal aspects as\nwell as the various types of yogîs. Now Arjuna asks for spe-\ncial clarification as to which is the better path – the path of\nbhakti-yoga centred on K®ß√a directly and performed with\nacts of devotion, or the impersonal path that tries to focus\non K®ß√a’s Brahman effulgence (brahma-jyoti).\n304\nBhagavad-gita\nThis is a question for many persons starting on the\npath of transcendence – which path is better, the personal\nor the impersonal? Here, Çrî K®ß√a says that the personal\npath is best. The bhakti-yogî, who is fixed in meditation on\nK®ß√a’s form of beauty, who constantly glorifies Him with\ngreat faith and determination is the best of yogîs.\nThe bhakti-yogîs that engage on the personal path of\nself-realisation are called Vaiß√avas. Those on the imper-\nsonal path are of three types – Brahmavådîs (Vedåntists),\nÇünyavådîs (Buddhists) and Måyåvådîs (Ça∫karites).\nBrahmavådîs are those who seek to merge the self (åtmå)\ninto the bodily effulgence of K®ß√a. Çünyavådîs seek to\nannihilate everything and enter the void (çünya) and the\nMåyåvådîs seek to become God themselves.\nThe Brahmavådîs seek to merge with the Brahman\neffulgence, but they have little or no knowledge of the\npersonal form of K®ß√a. Thus they only reach K®ß√a after\nmany lifetimes as will be explained in verse 4. In the annals\nof self-realisation, there are many instances of yogîs and\nBrahmavådîs failing to achieve Brahman realisation and\neven accounts of those such as the Four Kumåras, Vasiß†ha\nMuni, Çukadeva Gosvåmî and others, who after achieving\nBrahman realisation, abandoned that for the higher bliss\nof bhakti-yoga. For the seekers of çünya there is never\nsuccess because there is no çünya. There is no void any-\nwhere. There is nothing outside or beyond K®ß√a and so\nthe Çünyavådîs face great disappointment at the end of\nlife. The Måyåvådîs reject the personal form of K®ß√a as\na manifestation of måyå (illusion) and want to become\nGod themselves. Måyåvådîs are considered offenders and\nreturn to the world of birth and death.\nChapter 12\n305\nThroughout the Bhagavad-gîtå, K®ß√a’s statements are\nconsistent in that He repeatedly confirms that of all paths,\nbhakti-yoga is the best. Among all types of yogîs, jñånîs,\nphilosophers and philanthropists, the bhakti-yogî who is\nfully absorbed in K®ß√a without any material desires or the\ndesire for liberation, is the best and is very dear to Him.\nanyåbhilåßitå-çünyaµ jñåna-karmådy-anåv®tam\nånukülyena k®ß√ånu-çîlanaµ bhaktir-uttamå\nIn the highest plane of bhakti-yoga one is devoid of\nall material desires, material activities and the desire\nfor liberation. Such bhakti-yoga must be favoura-\nbly performed according to K®ß√a’s desire. (Bhak-\nti-rasåm®ta-sindhu 1.1.11)\nIt is further confirmed by the greatest impersonal phi-\nlosopher of all time, Çrîpåda Ådi Ça∫kara, who chastised\nhis disciples and told them that they should just worship\nK®ß√a (Govinda). Nothing else is required.\nbhaja govindaµ bhaja govindaµ bhaja govindaµ mü∂ha-mate\nsampråpte sannihite kåle na hi na hi rakßati ∂uk®ñ kara√e\nO foolish students, your repetition of grammatical\nrules and your philosophical speculation will not\nsave you at the time of death.

(Viß√u Purå√a 6.5.66-67).\nThat effulgence of K®ß√a is non-different from Him\nand shines like millions, and millions of suns.\nvåsudevåd abhinnas tu vahny-arkendu-çata-prabham\nvåsudevo ‘pi bhagavåµs tad-dharmå parameçvara˙\nsvåµ dîptiµ kßobhayaty eva tejaså tena vai yutam\nprakåça-rüpo bhagavån acyutam cåsak®d dvija\nThe effulgence of the impersonal Brahman is\nlike unlimited fires, suns and moons. Brahman is\nnon-different from Våsudeva (K®ß√a). Våsudeva is\nfull of all auspicious qualities and His nature is that\nHe is the Supreme Controller. When He removes\nthe covering of His own Brahman effulgence, K®ß√a\nreveals His original, eternal, transcendental form.\n(Nårada-pañcaråtra)\n308\nBhagavad-gita\nThe concept of liberation in the impersonal Brahman\nis often sought by those who are frustrated with material\nexistence, but who have no knowledge of K®ß√a. Certainly a\nsense of detachment and renunciation from material activ-\nities is laudable, but K®ß√a says that path is more trouble\nthan it is worth.\nIf one endeavours for the perfection of life by con-\ntrolling the senses, being equipoised in all circumstances,\ncultivates the impersonal Brahman conception, and at the\nsame time is dedicated to helping all living beings, then\nsuch a person may eventually reach K®ß√a consciousness.\nThe impersonal path, K®ß√a says, is very troublesome and\ndifficult to attain. Therefore, it is expected that ascending\nsuch a path can extend over many lifetimes and there is also\nthe chance of total failure and loss.\nThe Brahmavådîs must cultivate sense-control etc. as\nmentioned above with the study of Vedånta. After many\nlifetimes, by cultivating such knowledge, when the Brah-\nmavådî understands that K®ß√a is everything (våsudeva˙\nsarvam iti), he at last reaches Him. The Çünyavådî and\nthe Måyåvådî never reach K®ß√a until they adopt the path\nof bhakti-yoga. However, a Vaiß√ava may come to K®ß√a\nconsciousness in one lifetime."

Çrî K®ß√a tells Arjuna in verse 8 that the direct\napproach is to, “Fix your mind and intelligence on Me\nalone.” Such a stage is called rågånugå-bhakti, or sponta-\nneous devotion which is independent of the support of\nrules and regulations. However, this stage of rågånugå-\nbhakti is not easily achieved, especially for beginners. In\nthat case K®ß√a recommends the indirect approach to\nrågånugå-bhakti which is the constant practice of rules and\nregulations known as sådhana-bhakti. If such a practice is\nnot possible then K®ß√a suggests that one should work for\nHim. If one cannot do that, then He says that one should\nrenounce the results of one’s activities and offer them to\nHim. If one cannot do that, then one should engage in the\ncultivation of knowledge to understand what the body is,\n312\nBhagavad-gita\nwhat the åtmå is and who K®ß√a is. One will then gradually\nadvance from whatever stage they are at and progress to the\ntopmost stage of approaching K®ß√a directly in rågånugå-\nbhakti. This is also stated in Çrî Brahma-saµhitå as follows:\nprabuddhe jñåna-bhaktibhyåm åtmany ånanda-cinmayî\nudety anuttamå bhaktir bhagavat-prema-lakßa√å\nWhen transcendental experience awakens by means\nof knowledge and devotion, the highest devotion\nwhich is distinguished by the presence of pure love\nfor Çrî K®ß√a, the beloved of the åtmå, awakens in\none’s heart.

    "commentary": "Everyone in the world would like to see peace and\nharmony, but what prevails is quite the opposite. Verses\nthirteen to twenty offer a simple solution to most of the\nproblems in today’s world, and that is the self-improve-\nChapter 12\n315\nment of the individual. In other words, if people were to\ncultivate the qualities that Çrî K®ß√a has mentioned here,\nthe world would be a far better place. As it is now, the\nworld is no place for a gentleman. Being devoid of hatred,\nbeing friendly and compassionate to all living beings, being\ndevoid of any sense of possessiveness, free from egotism,\nobjective in all circumstances, forgiving, self-controlled,\nand being of strong determination etc. are indeed noble\nqualities. But how are people to develop them?\nIndependently these qualities, and other desirable qual-\nities of the human being mentioned throughout Bhaga-\nvad-gîtå are difficult to develop. It is seen that sometimes a\nperson may possess one, two or three of such qualities, but\nwhere is that person who has all these qualities?\nK®ß√a gives the answer in Bhagavad-gîtå – become a\nbhakti-yogî, take shelter of K®ß√a and surrender everything\nto Him. The åtmå is naturally complete with all good\nqualities as could ever be desired by a human being. When\none’s mind, intelligence, and consciousness are purified\nby being in association with K®ß√a through the process\nof bhakti-yoga, all desirable qualities develop. Therefore,\nthe open secret to life is that everyone should become a\nyogî in bhakti-yoga. Then the world would become a much\nbetter place.\nAbove all good qualities is the quality of devotion to\nthe Supreme Person, from which all other good qualities\nmanifest in great abundance. One does not become dear to\nK®ß√a simply by independently developing good qualities.\nAll such qualities must be dovetailed with the quality of\ndevotion. One who approaches life in that way is a true\nbhakti-yogî and is very dear to K®ß√a.\n316\nBhagavad-gita\nॐ तिदित ीमहाभारते शतसाहां संिहतायां\nवैयािसां भीपवािण ीमगवीतासूपिनष\nिवायां योगशाे ीकाजनसंवादे\nभियोगो नाम ादशोऽायः॥\noµ tat saditi çrî-mahåbhårate-çata-såhasryåµ saµhitåyåµ\nvaiyåsikyåµ bhîßma-parvå√i\nçrîmad bhagavad-gîtåsüpanißatsu\nbrahma-vidyåyåµ yoga-çåstre çrî k®ß√årjuna-saµvåde\nbhakti-yogo nåma dvådaço’dhyåya˙\nOÂ TAT SAT – Thus ends Chapter Twelve entitled\nBhakti Yoga from the conversation between Çrî K®ß√a and\nArjuna in the Upanißad known as Çrîmad Bhagavad-gîtå,\nthe yoga-çåstra of divine knowledge, from the Bhîßma-\nparva of Mahåbhårata, the literature revealed by Vyåsa in\none hundred thousand verses.\nChapter 13\n319"

In other words, they conclude that the\nbody is the self. Bhagavad-gîtå however, considers such an\nunderstanding to be ignorance. Without understanding the\ndifference between material nature (prak®ti) and the self\n(kßetrajña) who is the conscious knower of the body, there\nis no basis of real knowledge. Both are distinct from one\nanother and one who understands this is truly learned.\nThe material body composed of the three subtle ele-\nments (mind, intelligence and false ego) and the five gross\nelements (earth, water, fire, air and space) is known as\nthe field. The indwelling consciousness is known as the\nknower of the field, and the Super Consciousness situated\nwithin all bodies and within the individual consciousness\nis the knower of all fields of activity.

Unfortunately, this knowledge is completely\nlacking in modern societies, both eastern and western. All\ncontemporary fields of knowledge i.e. biology, physics, math-\nematics and philosophy lead one to accept the body as the\nself and to accept gratification of one’s mind, intelligence,\nego and senses as the goal of life. Such an understanding is\nutterly devoid of the real purpose of life, considering that this\none life is the all in all and that after death there is nothing.\nThe material world is a place of birth, death, old age\nand disease and is sometimes referred to as m®tyu-loka or\nthe planet of death. Birth, death, old age and disease are\nindeed the real problems facing all living beings regardless\nof race, nationality or belief. Any knowledge that does not\naim to put an end to these miseries is certainly incomplete\nat best. There are, of course, medicines, drugs, surgery and\nmedical machines to ease the pain of birth, slow the old\nage process, cure some diseases and prolong the process of\ndying, but these are only stopgaps or temporary solutions.\nOne should recognise these problems of life and be\ninquisitive as to where the real solution is to be found.\n324\nBhagavad-gita\nContrary to modern scientific and philosophical under-\nstanding, the Bhagavad-gîtå says that this one life is not the\nall in all, and that there is life after death. There was life\nbefore coming to this material world and that life contin-\nues eternally. All that really changes is the type of body\none has. For the pious there is future life in higher plan-\nets enjoying celestial pleasures, for the ignorant there are\nfuture sojourns within the bodies of lower species such as\nanimals or plants, and for the yogî and for those who culti-\nvate knowledge of consciousness and Super Consciousness,\nthere is future existence beyond the material universes in\nthe Vaiku√†ha planets. There, life is eternal and all bodies\nare of the substance known as sac-cid-ånanda (eternity,\nknowledge and bliss)."

His hands, feet, eyes and\nears are everywhere and He is situated in the hearts of all\nliving beings. He is all-pervasive throughout the universe,\nChapter 13\n327\nHe divides Himself to be within all things, yet He Himself\nis not divided or diminished – He remains the Complete\nPerson. This is stated in the invocation of the ˆçopanißad\nas follows:\noµ pür√am ada˙ pür√am idaµ pür√åt pür√am udacyate\npür√asya pür√am ådåya pür√am evåvaçißyate\nThe Supreme Person is perfect and complete, and\nbecause He is completely perfect, all emanations\nfrom Him, such as this material world, are also\nperfect and complete. Whatever emanates from the\nComplete Person is also complete in itself. Because\nHe is the Complete Person, even though so many\ncomplete units emanate from Him, He remains the\ncomplete balance.\nIt would seem that the discourse between the theist and\nthe atheist is perpetually in a gridlock. But as mentioned\nnot consider either the so-called theist or the atheist to\nhave complete knowledge. It may even be that sometimes\nthe atheist is more correct in his opinion than the so-called\ntheist. The theist establishes his God, and the atheist, upon\nexamining the statements of the so-called theist, discovers\nthat the God in question is wrathful, vindictive, jealous,\nvengeful, sadomasochistic etc. In this instance we would\nhave to agree with the atheist – there is no such God.\nHowever, the atheist then concludes that in the absence\nof God, the universe and all life within it has come from\nnothing – yet he has no experience or proof that something\ncan arise from nothing. His proposal is thus self-defeating.\n328\nBhagavad-gita\nBoth ‘God’ and His non-existence are but misconcep-\ntions in the minds of the so-called theist and the atheist.\nHowever, the student of Bhagavad-gîtå knows that the sub-\nject matter is not a thesis about ‘God’. Bhagavad-gîtå is a\ndiscourse aimed at enlightenment in the Absolute Truth.\nThe Absolute Truth contains all things known, knowable\nand unknown – before the universe, within the universe,\nafter the universe and beyond the universe."

    "commentary": "It is described that both material nature (prak®ti) and\nthe living beings (jîvåtmå or purußa) are without beginning\n(anådi). This means that material nature and the living\nbeings exist as eternal energies of Çrî K®ß√a before the\nprocess of creation takes place. The living being’s origin\nis in the ta†asthå, or marginal plane, before the onslaught\nof time. In this regard, the origin of the living beings and\nmaterial nature are both anådi, or having no first cause.\nChapter 13\n331\nThey are without a first cause because they are çaktis, or\npotencies of the Absolute Truth who is Himself without\norigin. In other words, the cause of all causes is Çrî K®ß√a.\nThus, He is known as sarva-kåra√a-kåra√am.\nThough material nature and the living beings are eter-\nnal and without beginning, they nonetheless have distinctly\ndifferent qualities and characteristics. They are not the\nsame. Material nature is described as the body, senses and\nother elements as well as the transformations of qualities\nsuch as happiness, distress, lamentation and illusion. The\nliving beings are part and parcel of the Supreme Person.\nThey are sac-cid-ånanda – having the constitution of eter-\nnity, knowledge and bliss. When the living beings identify\nthe self as the material body, they suffer under the miser-\nies of happiness and distress and perpetually transmigrate\nfrom one body to the next in the cycle of birth and death.\nOne of the greatest questions in life, namely, “Where\ndo we come from?” is certainly answered in Bhagavad-gîtå.\nYet the use of the word anådi in verse 20 has encouraged\nsome thinkers to conclude that the living beings have\nalways been in the material world. In other words, that\nalthough the living beings are eternal, they begin in the\nmaterial universe and have always been in the material\nuniverse. This conclusion however is not supported by\nprevious åcåryas of the Bhagavad-gîtå such as Viçvanåtha\nCakravartî, Baladeva Vidyåbhüßa√a and others. To them,\nanådi means beginningless, before time began.\nRegarding the origin of the living beings and their\nbeginning as anådi, the Vaiß√ava åcårya Svåmî B. R.\nÇrîdhara Mahåråja says as follows:\n332\nBhagavad-gita\nSince time immemorial, man has inquired about the\norigin of the living being. Who am I? Where have I\ncome from? How does the living being first appear in\nthis world? From what stage of spiritual existence does\nhe fall into the material world?\nThere are two classes of living beings who come\ninto this world. One class comes from the spiritual\nVaiku√†ha planets by the necessity of nitya-lîlå,\nthe eternal pastimes of K®ß√a. Another comes by\nconstitutional necessity. The brahma-jyoti, the non-\ndifferentiated marginal plane, is the source of infinite\nliving beings (jîvåtmås), atomic spiritual particles of\nnon-differentiated character.\nThe rays of the transcendental body of the Supreme\nPerson are known as the brahma-jyoti, and a ray\nof the brahma-jyoti is the jîvåtmå. The jîvåtmå is\nan atom in that effulgence, and the brahma-jyoti is\na product of an infinite number of jîvåtmå atoms.\nGenerally, jîvåtmås emanate from the brahma-jyoti\nwhich is living and growing. Within the brahma-jyoti,\ntheir equilibrium is somehow disturbed and movement\nbegins. From non-differentiation, differentiation\nbegins. From a plain sheet of uniform consciousness,\nindividual conscious units grow. And because the\njîvåtmå is conscious it is endowed with free will.\nFrom the marginal position (ta†asthå-çakti) they\nchoose either the side of exploitation (material world)\nor the side of dedication (Vaiku√†ha). K®ß√a bhuli\nsei jîva anådi bahirmukha. Anådi means that which\nhas no beginning. When we enter the land of exploita-\nChapter 13\n333\ntion, we come within the factor of time, space and\nthought. And when we come to exploit, action and\nreaction begins in the negative land of loan.\nWhen the jîvåtmå, by exercise of his free will and out\nof curiosity, first enters into this land – from then he\nbecomes a factor of this limited world. But his partic-\nipation is beyond the beginning of this limited world.\nThat is why it is said to be anådi. Anådi means that\nit does not come from within the jurisdiction of this\nlimited world.\nOnce subject to contact with material nature, the living\nbeings are then subject to karma, the laws of action and\nreaction. Under these laws the living beings enjoy and suffer\nin various species of life. During their material sojourn,\nthe Paramåtmå accompanies the living beings and is ever\nwatchful for when they will turn their head towards the\nAbsolute Truth. The Paramåtmå directs the wanderings of\nthe living beings, and when one desires to know the Truth,\nthe Paramåtmå manifests before the living beings as the\nspiritual master who teaches Bhagavad-gîtå as it is. Hence\nthe living being transcends the world of birth and death.\nbrahmå√∂a brahmite kona bhågyavån jîva\nguru-k®ß√a prasåde påya bhakti-latå-bîja\nAccording to their karma, the jîvåtmås are wandering\nthroughout the universe. Some jîvåtmås who are most\nfortunate receive the mercy of guru and K®ß√a, and\nby such mercy they receive the seed of the creeper of\ndevotion. (Caitanya-caritåm®ta, Madhya-lîlå 19.151)\n334\nBhagavad-gita"

Moving species consist of humans, animals, fish\netc. Non-moving objects include trees, mountains, miner-\nals etc. Çrî K®ß√a says that all these moving and non-mov-\ning things are a combination of material nature and the\nliving beings. One who has deeper vision sees that the\nSuper Consciousness is the Controller of all things and is\nsituated in the hearts of all living beings, within every atom\nand in between every atom. Such a seer is a true knower\nand realises that consciousness and Super Consciousness\nare both eternal and imperishable.\n336\nBhagavad-gita\nA seer of the truth is never degraded by the influences\nof material nature. He gradually rises to perfection and\nattains the Supreme Abode of K®ß√a. Those who are con-\nditioned by material nature and who have no knowledge\nof Super Consciousness wrongly conceive that they are the\ndoer of activities, or that they are the overlords of material\nnature. This however is a foolish idea since they themselves\nare helplessly suffering at the hands of death.\nFor those that have the eyes to see, all forms of life\nindicate the presence of a conscious living being. That\nis to say that not just humans are conscious or that only\nhuman consciousness is eternal. All things that manifest\nbirth, growth, maintenance, reproduction, dwindling and\ndeath, regardless of higher birth (human) or lower birth\n(animal), are known as eternal beings transmigrating in\nthe material world. Thus, one who is friendly, kind and\ncompassionate must be so to all forms of life. It is not that\nhumans are spared but animals and others can be killed\nor exploited for our pleasure. This idea falls short of the\nvision of Bhagavad-gîtå which sees all living beings as part\nand parcel of the Supreme Person, K®ß√a. Thus, all living\nbeings have a right to life."

In other\nwords, the knowledge contained in Bhagavad-gîtå is perfect\nand complete. By transcending the modes of nature, Çrî\nK®ß√a promises that one will be liberated from the miseries\nof birth, death, old age and disease and one will taste the\nnectar of immortality. This is also confirmed in the ˆço-\npanißad as follows:\nvidyåµ cåvidyåµ ca yas tad vedobhayaµ saha\navidyayå m®tyuµ tîrtvå vidyayåm®tam açnute\nOne who transcends ignorance (avidyå) and attains\ntranscendental knowledge certainly rises above the\ninfluence of repeated birth and death and tastes the\nnectar of immortality. (ˆçopanißad 11)\nThe contemporary world view of advancement of\nknowledge is that knowledge is attained through direct\nevidence, experiment, hypothesis and speculation. This\nprocess of acquiring knowledge is called åroha-panthå, or\nthe ascending process. However, the ascending process\n352\nBhagavad-gita\nof knowledge relies completely on the mind, intelligence\nand senses and is thus subject to the four material defects\nof mistakes, illusion, cheating and false perception.\nAccordingly, no scientific knowledge is perfect, nor can\nit be perfect. Truly, by the admission of many scientists,\nthey never really attain the end of knowledge. The more\nthey learn, the more there is to learn, or the more they\nlearn, the more they discover that their predecessors were\nwrong. In any case, scientists admit that they do not have\nperfect knowledge – death comes and another generation\nof scientists is reduced to dust.\nKnowledge that is descending from Çrî K®ß√a and\nthrough the guru-disciple paramparå is known as avaroha-\npanthå and is free from material defects. Bhagavad-gîtå\nmeans the words of Çrî K®ß√a – hearing which enables one\nto achieve the perfection of life before death comes."

In\nthe Supreme Abode of K®ß√a, known by great self-realised\nyogîs as Goloka V®ndåvana, everything is filled with the\nself-effulgence of K®ß√a.\nna tatra süryo bhåti na candra-tårakaµ\nnemå vidyuto bhånti kuto’yam agni˙\ntam eva bhåntam anubhåti sarvaµ\ntasya bhåså sarvam idaµ vibhåti\nThe sun does not shine there, nor the moon, nor the\nstars, nor does lightning shine. How then can fire\nburn? When The Supreme Being shines, all these\nshine. Through His effulgence He illuminates all\nthings. (Ka†ha Upanißad 2.2.15)\nK®ß√a also says that once attaining that Supreme Abode,\none never returns to this world of birth and death. The\nmaterial world is filled with unlimited fallibilities, but the\nSupreme Abode is infallible. The fallibility of the material\nworld includes envy, greed, lust, hate, vengefulness etc. but\nthese material qualities cannot enter the abode of K®ß√a.\nSome thinkers have postulated that the living beings in\nthis material world have originally fallen from their eternal\n364\nBhagavad-gita\nposition in the Supreme Abode. Such persons are known\nas ‘Fall-vådîs’. According to the thinking of the ‘Fall-\nvådîs’, the Supreme Abode is fallible and subject to envy,\ndissatisfaction, greed, hate and so on. The word ‘fallible’\ncomes from the Latin word fallere that means ‘to deceive’.\nIn order to deceive there must be ignorance, forgetfulness\nand suspicion etc. However, considering that no material\nqualities exist in the Supreme Abode, it is not possible for\nany liberated living being there to become contaminated\nby material qualities.\nK®ß√a says that once going to that abode one never\nreturns to the material world (yad gatvå na nivartante).\nK®ß√a does not say that going again to that Supreme Abode\none never returns. Therefore, it is understood by K®ß√a’s\nown words that no one falls from the Supreme Abode.\nAll living beings in the spiritual and material worlds are\neternally K®ß√a’s parts and particles – mamaivåµço jîva-\nloke jîva-bhüta˙ sanåtana˙. However, the living beings who\nare conditioned by material nature and who have no con-\ntrol of their senses or knowledge of the Supreme Abode,\nare again and again reborn within the world of birth and\ndeath. At the time of death they are carried away to their\nnext body by material desires and the mind, just as a fra-\ngrance is carried by the wind."

    "commentary": "The inability to discriminate between proper and\nimproper actions is the first recognisable characteristic of\nan asura. Additionally, Çrî K®ß√a says, they do not know\nwhat is purity, proper behaviour or truthfulness. Truth-\nfulness, cleanliness, austerity and mercy are most desirable\nqualities for a human being, but these are totally lacking in\none who has acquired the nature of an asura.\nÇrî K®ß√a continues to describe in detail the qualities\nand characteristics of the asura mentality and if one takes\ncareful note of what K®ß√a is saying, then one is faced with\nthe stark realisation that the world we live in today is dom-\ninated by the thinking and activities of the asuras.\nThe structure of our world is now based on rampant\nconsumerism, the ‘shop till you drop’ mentality. Enjoy,\nenjoy, enjoy! The ‘if it feels good, do it’ mentality is every-\nwhere. We are led to believe that there is no ultimate reality,\nthat this one life is the all in all, and therefore we should\nenjoy it while it lasts – the fulfilment of the sexual lust of\nmen and women being at the forefront of such enjoyment.\nThe epitome of this is represented worldwide by the casual\nand legal acceptance of contraception and abortion.\nWith the present mentality of the human being, it seems\nthat the world is set on a path of destruction – with dev-\nastation of the environment, economic collapse, extinction\nof species and even genocide of certain races of humans.\nHave we no eyes to see what is happening? Has the human\nrace become so proud and arrogant of it’s achievements\nthat it has become blind?\nGood government is essential in a civilised world. Such\na government is for the purpose of safeguarding society\nChapter 16\n383\nfrom danger – not just from the danger of an invading\narmy, but also from the threat of unwholesome ideolo-\ngies that may destroy a civilisation from within. Unfor-\ntunately, it seems as though governments worldwide have\nabandoned all sense of proper behaviour and they them-\nselves have become the leading plunderers of the people.\nAmassing wealth by any means and depriving the people\nfrom even the most basic necessities of life, such despots\nknow no shame. Indeed, the world is in a period of great\ndarkness at the hands of the asura mentality.\nFrom their high pulpits the heads of state declare, “Our\nenemies must be killed. The evildoers must be defeated.\nWe shall be victorious, we shall rule the world, we shall\nenjoy, we are the chosen people, we are powerful, we are\nhappy and none are our equals!” And while the hysteria of\nthe masses runs wild, the innocent are sent to their graves\nand the Earth weeps for her children. Yet it seems we are\nunfazed. Such, K®ß√a says, is our ignorance."

    "commentary": "In this chapter Çrî K®ß√a answers the question of Arjuna\nregarding those who reject the Vedas, but perform worship\nwith some faith. Arjuna wants to know to which mode of\nmaterial nature they belong. The first lesson to learn here\nis that by not following the Vedic injunctions one auto-\nmatically acts as one likes, but is henceforth always under\nthe modes of material nature – goodness, passion and\nignorance. Thus, one is never situated in transcendence.\nÇrî K®ß√a then further describes food, sacrifice, austerity\nand charity as they are influenced by, or born of, the three\nmodes of material nature.\nFirst faith (çraddhå) is discussed. Çrî K®ß√a tells Arjuna\nthat çraddhå arises in this life due to one’s own nature and\nfrom impressions in the mind from previous lives. All\nactivities in life depend on faith to one degree or another.\nIt does not matter what one’s creed may be – theist or\natheist, one must have faith. The theist has faith that there\nis a God, and the atheist has faith that there is no God. If\none states a particular doctrine or philosophy, but says he\nhas no ‘faith’ then that is pure hypocrisy.\nK®ß√a says that when one’s faith is in the mode of\ngoodness, one worships the demigods such as Ga√eça,\nÇiva, Sürya, Indra and Sarasvatî etc. When one’s faith is in\nthe mode of passion, one worships the spirits in nature or\nthe ancestors – this also includes humanists and atheists.\nWhen one’s faith is in the mode of ignorance, one is found\nto worship ghosts and spirits. All these types of worship\nare current in the world today.\nIn India, many people worship the demigods by building\nbig temples and offering fire sacrifices known as yajñas. In\n394\nBhagavad-gita\nthe Far East, ancestor worship is very popular amongst the\nBuddhists, Shintoists and Taoists. Similarly, in Europe and\nAmerica, great monuments are erected to revere scientists,\npoliticians, soldiers, movie stars, rock stars etc. In Africa,\nTibet, Mexico and South America, the worship of ghosts\nand spirits is popular. All these forms of worship are con-\nducted in the three modes of material nature. Therefore,\nhaving rejected the Vedas, it is to be concluded that the\nworshippers of demigods, ancestors, famous personalities,\nghosts and spirits are not transcendentally situated.\nTo be transcendental to material nature means to\naccept the Vedas and thus be situated beyond the modes\nof nature in the realm of viçuddha-sattva, pure goodness.\nWhen one’s faith is situated in pure goodness, one wor-\nships the Supreme Person, K®ß√a. This is the highest stage\nof monotheism – the acceptance of one Supreme Being.\nPure-goodness is described by Çiva as follows:\nsattvaµ viçuddhaµ vasudeva-çabditaµ\nyad îyate tatra pumån apåv®ta˙\nsattve ca tasmin bhagavån våsudevo\nhy adhokßajo me namaså vidhîyate\nOne should always worship K®ß√a in pure goodness.\nPure goodness is always pure consciousness in which\nthe Absolute Truth, known as Våsudeva, is revealed\nwithout any covering. (Çrîmad Bhågavatam 4.3.23)\nIn the stage of pure consciousness, one is guided by\nthe highest type of faith called nirgu√a-çraddhå, transcen-\ndental faith that is uncontaminated by the modes of mate-\nrial nature. After many lifetimes of following the Vedas\nChapter 17\n395\nand associating with the virtuous and pious, one develops\nsuk®ti, accumulated merit. This suk®ti then leads one to the\nassociation of sådhus (self-realised yogîs) and under their\nguidance nirgu√a-çraddhå develops and progresses through\nvarious stages – ultimately reaching the highest stage of\nself-realisation, prema-bhakti.\nNirgu√a-çraddhå awakens in the heart of the bhakti-yogî\nand enables one to see, hear and feel the subjective world,\nthe Absolute Truth. Nirgu√a-çraddhå is that which reveals\nK®ß√a just as a flash of lightning reveals the shape of a\nmonsoon rain cloud in the dead of night. In the darkness\nof night, the cloud cannot be seen, but when lightning\nappears, the form of the cloud becomes visible. Similarly,\nwhen nirgu√a-çraddhå appears in the heart of the yogî, one\ncan perceive the ultimate form of beauty that is Çrî K®ß√a.\nGuided by nirgu√a-çraddhå, the student of bhakti-yoga\nwill feel that one is meant for K®ß√a – that he is not an\nindependent being. One must feel completely dependent on\nK®ß√a. Such is the process of understanding the Supreme\nPerson, who is beyond the modes of material nature.\nK®ß√a says that one who is driven by lust, ambition,\npower, pride and egotism often undergoes severe austerities\nthat are not prescribed in the Vedas or in the process of\nbhakti-yoga – such austerities parch the senses of the body.\nThese may include austerities such as prolonged periods\nof fasting, self-flagellation, self-crucifixion, wearing cilice\nchains, piercing the body, walking on hot coals and so on.\nBecause these austerities are performed in the mode of\nignorance they neglect the Paramåtmå within – thus lead-\ning to no good result. K®ß√a says the performers of such\nausterities are to be known as asuras.\n396\nBhagavad-gita"

These are basically known as vegetarian\nfoods and are dear to those in the mode of goodness.\nFood that is too bitter, too sour, too sweet, too salty,\ntoo spicy, too pungent and too dry, that creates excessive\nheat in the stomach, causes pain, creates gas and disease is\nto be known as food in the mode of passion. Such food\nmay be vegetarian, but it is usually over-salted, and over-\nspiced. Too much salt and spice creates mucus in the body\nand leads to such diseases as high blood pressure, heart\nfailure, diabetes and cancer. Such food should be avoided.\n398\nBhagavad-gita\nK®ß√a says that food that is stale, tasteless, foul smell-\ning, rotten, left behind by others or unfit for sacrifice, is\nfood in the mode of ignorance. Food left behind by others\nmeans the scraps left behind on someone’s plate, that in\nwestern countries, are usually fed to dogs and cats. Food\nnot fit for sacrifice means that food contaminated by an\nanimal, or that has come in contact with something filthy\nand impure.\nFood in the mode of ignorance may include some veg-\netarian food that has become contaminated. Food in the\nmode of ignorance generally pertains to all varieties of\nnon-vegetarian foodstuff such as meat, fish and eggs. These\ninclude beef, mutton, goat, pig, chicken, venison, turkey,\nduck, turtle, prawn, crab, frog, insect, snake, clam, oyster,\nshark, whale, caviar, horse and dog, just to name a few.\nAbsurd as it may sound to the student of bhakti-yoga, all\nthe food mentioned above is very popular in various parts\nof the world. Such food is to be avoided by all classes of\nyogîs, as well as by progressive human beings in general.\nAll types of yogîs prefer food in the mode of goodness,\nbut the bhakti-yogîs prefer to eat only the remnants of food\nin the mode of goodness that has first been offered to Çrî\nK®ß√a with love and devotion (yo me bhaktyå prayacchati).\nSuch remnants are called prasådam or mahå-prasådam.\nEven eating food in the mode of goodness carries a\nkarmic reaction if it is not first offered to K®ß√a. This\nhas also been mentioned in Bhagavad-gîtå, Chapter Three,\nverse 13 as follows:\nyajña-çiß†åçina˙ santo mucyante sarva-kilbißai˙\nbhuñjate te tvaghaµ påpå ye pacanty-åtma-kåra√åt\nChapter 17\n399\nSaintly persons are liberated from all types of impi-\nety by accepting the remnants of foodstuffs offered\nin sacrifice (to K®ß√a). However, those who only\ncook for themselves perpetuate their own bondage.\nFood that is to be offered to K®ß√a must be prepared\nwith love and devotion, and in a kitchen that is clean and\nwhere domestic pets such as cats and dogs do not enter.\nEveryone loves their pets – indeed, Çrî K®ß√a Himself\nloves His two pet dogs, Vyåghra and Bhramaraka, as well\nas other animals. However, pets should not be allowed in\nthe kitchen where offerings are prepared.\nThe student of bhakti-yoga should not be a fanatic, but\nshould practice moderation in all things. However, the\nyogî should be diligent to avoid food in the modes of pas-\nsion and ignorance."

    "commentary": "For every age the Vedic literature recommends a par-\nticular sacrifice for those desiring self-realisation. It should\nbe noted that those sacrifices are never in the category of\nblood sacrifice. In other words, those seeking self-realisa-\ntion never perform animal or human sacrifice. Both animal\nand human sacrifice have been practiced in many parts of\nthe world since ancient times, but at no time in history\nhave there been animal or human sacrifices performed by\nthose seeking self-realisation in bhakti-yoga.\nIn today’s world, some religious sects sacrifice animals\nbefore eating them. Similar rituals are performed in other\nsects wherein a symbolic representation of the blood and\nbody of a saint are eaten. However, one should know that\nall such barbaric activities are completely absent in the\npractice of bhakti-yoga.\nChapter 17\n401\nIn the modern age, the Vedic literature gives recom-\nmendation for only one sacrifice and that is k®ß√a-sa∫kîr-\ntana in which one chants the mahå-mantra, preceded by\nthe pañca-tattva mantra:\njaya çrî k®ß√a caitanya, prabhu nityånanda\njaya advaita gadådhara çrîvåsådi gaura-bhakta-v®nda\nhare k®ß√a hare k®ß√a k®ß√a k®ß√a hare hare\nhare råma hare råma råma råma hare hare\nThe chanting of the pañca-tattva mantra is to precede\nthe mahå-mantra and frees the chanter from any previous\noffences that may have been committed knowingly or\nunknowingly. When the performance of k®ß√a-sa∫kîrtana\nis done alongside the distribution of K®ß√a mahå-prasådam\nit is considered perfect and complete. In the age of Kali-\nyuga no other sacrifice is necessary."

This\nmay also include fasting for political, social or economic\nadvantages. Austerities performed out of foolishness that\ncause pain and suffering should also be rejected. All such\nausterities are thus abandoned because they are performed\n404\nBhagavad-gita\nin the modes of passion and ignorance – the results of\nwhich are temporary and do not promote self-realisation.\nSpeaking truthfully, but not in such a way as to offend\nothers, is known as verbal austerity.

    "commentary": "Now the ideal of charity is being discussed – what types\nof charity should be performed, to whom and for what pur-\npose. It is certainly the duty of every person to look out for\nhis fellow human being. As such, no one should go hungry\nin this world, be without clothing, proper shelter, educa-\ntion or sufficient medical care. That is the ideal for human\nsociety. But our present reality is quite different – there\nare shortages of food, inadequate clothing, shelter, educa-\ntion and medical treatment in many places in the world,\ncausing millions of human beings to suffer unnecessarily.\nThis suffering, however, is not due to a lack of commodi-\n406\nBhagavad-gita\nties as much as it is due to mismanagement and hoarding.\nThere are sufficient facilities to maintain everyone on this\nEarth in a proper state of health and well-being, but the\nfacilities are simply mismanaged. And more to blame than\nthe mismanagement between the ‘haves’ and the ‘have-nots’\nof this world, is hoarding. There is enough wealth in the\nworld to easily solve the problems facing humanity, par-\nticularly that of hunger – but that wealth is being hoarded\nby a very small minority of people. They have amassed\nso much that no individual could spend or use that much\nwealth within one or even a dozen lifetimes. Corporate\ngiants receive millions of dollars in annual bonuses while\nmillions of children die each year due to malnutrition. Is\nthis not shameful?\nCharity, like other things discussed in this chapter, is\nalso in the different modes of nature according to how it is\ngiven and whom it is given to. There is charity in goodness,\npassion and ignorance as stated by Çrî K®ß√a above, but\nultimately the highest charity is to give that which helps\nthe human being bring an end to all material miseries and\neven to death itself. Such charity is the distribution of the\nspiritual wealth found in Bhagavad-gîtå.\nThe root cause of all suffering in the world is a lack of\nunderstanding of who we are, where we have come from,\nwhat the purpose of life is and where we will go at the\ntime of death. One who understands these things from the\nperspective of Bhagavad-gîtå becomes full in knowledge,\nfree from the illusion of the body as the self and ultimately\ndefeats death. This is the highest gift and greatest charity\nthat one can give a fellow human being.\nChapter 17\n407"

A\nsannyåsî performs all types of actions, but does so only in\nbhakti-yoga, in the service of K®ß√a.\nThe social structure of the bhakti-yoga community is\ndivided into four spiritual orders – brahmacårî, g®hastha,\nvånaprastha and sannyåsa. All these are to study the Vedic\nliterature. Additionally, their duties are as follows: the\nbrahmacårîs are the students, whose duties are service to the\nspiritual master and the observance of celibacy. G®hasthas\nare the householders, whose duties are to earn an honest\nliving, to give in charity and to raise children. Vånaprasthas\nare those who have completed household affairs and whose\nduties are to relinquish their wealth, visit holy places and\ncultivate detachment. The sannyåsîs are the spiritual mas-\nters in the bhakti-yoga community and they are to give\nlessons to the brahmacårîs, g®hasthas and vånaprasthas, to\nbe renounced from worldly pleasure, to be detached from\npolitics and to always be engaged in bhakti-yoga with kaya,\nmana, våkya, jîva – by body, mind, words and the full sur-\nrender of the self. Sannyåsa and tyåga are further described\nin the coming verses."

Only\nthe bhakti-yogî can truly celebrate freedom.\nÇrî K®ß√a says that happiness in the mode of good-\nness is bitter in the beginning, but nectar in the end. This\nChapter 18\n431\nmeans that to control the senses and perform austerities\n(tapasya) in the beginning may be distasteful for the\nnovice, but in the end such austerities lead to the nectar\nof self-realisation.\nHappiness derived from enjoying one’s senses in the\nmode of passion may be like nectar in the beginning, but\nit is bitter in the end because sense gratification ultimately\nends in frustration, hatred and anger. Happiness that arises\nfrom sleep, laziness and delusion and is self-deceptive is\nin the mode of ignorance because it is miserable in the\nbeginning and miserable in the end.\nReal happiness only comes when one awakens to the\neternal self and lives a life with one’s body, mind and\nsenses absorbed in a higher conscious plane."

    "commentary": "Herein, the status of the bråhma√as, kßatriyas, vaiçyas\nand çüdras are described according to the qualities of their\nwork. These are the four social orders of life and they are\npresent in all civilised cultures in the world. Everywhere\nwe find those that resemble the bråhma√as, the intellectual\nclass. Everywhere there are those that resemble kßatriyas,\nadministrators and warriors, and everywhere we find the\nmercantile and labour class, the vaiçyas and çüdras. These\nChapter 18\n433\nare the natural divisions in society and they are determined\nby the quality of their work.\nUnfortunately, in modern India, this social system\ndescribed by Çrî K®ß√a in the Bhagavad-gîtå has become\ncorrupted and is now known as the caste system which\ndetermines one’s social status by birth. The caste system\nis not actually the social system described in Bhagavad-gîtå\nknown as var√åçrama-dharma.\nThe caste system in India is certainly deplorable, hardly\nbetter than that of slavery, because it limits a person’s\npotential according to one’s birth. K®ß√a clearly states that\na person is to be known by his actions and not his pedigree.\nAlthough social systems having intellectuals, adminis-\ntrators, mercantile and labour classes are found around the\nworld, they are also not the same as the var√åçrama system\nmentioned in Bhagavad-gîtå.\nIn addition to being an intellectual, a bråhma√a must\nknow what is Brahman. A kßatriya must do more than just\nadministrate and fight battles – he must be above corrup-\ntion, give protection to the people and protect the prin-\nciples of dharma found in Bhagavad-gîtå. And above all, a\nkßatriya is never to be an aggressor – he is never to invade\na sovereign country.\nThe duty of a vaiçya, in addition to business, is farm-\ning and cow protection. Naturally, the purpose of busi-\nness is to earn a living, but nowadays this has gone far\nbeyond actual necessity as per the advice of Bhagavad-gîtå.\nSimple business has turned into massive industry – the\nestablishing of mega multi-national corporations, money\nhoarding and fractional banking. These in turn have led to\nthe corruption of government officials around the world\n434\nBhagavad-gita\nand ultimately to the destruction of the environment,\nincreased poverty, and war.\nCow protection (k®ßi-gorakßya) is especially mentioned\nin verse 44 because of all animals it is the cow that is most\nnecessary for the survival of the human being. Human\nbodies thrive on animal fat and the cow is the animal that\nprovides human beings with the most milk, yogurt, butter,\ncheese etc. Milk and milk products, when taken in appro-\npriate quantities, provide the human being all the necessary\nfat required for healthy living, thus enabling the suspen-\nsion of animal slaughter. In other words, killing animals\nand eating meat is not necessary to obtain fat. When cows\nare protected then there will be plenty of whole milk avail-\nable for everyone to maintain a healthy diet. The value of\nthe cow for human society is indisputable and therefore\nin Vedic culture the cow is considered one of the seven\nnatural mothers. These seven mothers are as follows:\nåtma-måtå guro˙ patnî bråhma√î råja-patnikå\ndhenur dhåtrî tathå p®thvî saptaitå måtara˙ sm®tå˙\nOne’s own mother, the wife of the guru, the wife of\na bråhma√a, the king’s wife, the cow, the nurse and\nthe Earth – these should be considered as our seven\nmothers. (Cå√akya Nîti-çåstra 5.23)\nUnfortunately, the business community has turned to\ncorporate farming and mass slaughter of cows and other\nanimals in the name of delivering health and prosperity to\nthe people. In actuality, the people have lost their lands\nand the family farm that was once the backbone of socie-\nties everywhere has ceased to exist. Industrial farming has\nChapter 18\n435\nreplaced organic fertilisers with chemical fertilisers that\nrender the soil lifeless and produce food that is low in\nnutrition and high in toxic content. The meat from the\nslaughterhouse is also toxic and far less healthy than a\nvegetarian diet.\nSociety cries for the return of the vaiçya worldwide, but\ngovernments turn a deaf ear and a blind eye and it is the\nçüdra, the labourer class, at the tail end of the food chain\nwho suffers the most. But change is in the air as people\nworldwide wake up from the nightmare that has become\ntheir reality and seek genuine answers to their problems.\nFor such sincere persons, Bhagavad-gîtå will provide much\ninsight and guidance."

But because\nArjuna is very dear to K®ß√a and because K®ß√a is Arju-\nna’s guru and well-wisher, K®ß√a again gives him one last\ninstruction and assurance.\nK®ß√a’s final instruction is that Arjuna should always\nfix his mind upon Him, he should devote himself fully to\nHim, worship Him and offer his respects unto Him. This\nis the essence of K®ß√a consciousness. K®ß√a says that by\ndoing this Arjuna will surely come to Him. The ultimate\ninstruction to always remember K®ß√a is also stated in\nPadma Purå√a as follows:\nsmartavya˙ satataµ viß√ur vismartavyo na jåtucit\nsarve vidhi-nißedhå˙ syur etayor eva ki∫karå˙\nÇrî K®ß√a (Viß√u) should always be remembered and\nnever be forgotten at anytime. All rules and regula-\ntions mentioned in the çåstra should be subservient\nto these two principles. (Padma Purå√a 6.71.100)\n444\nBhagavad-gita\nIn verse sixty-six, we find the climax of Bhagavad-gîtå,\nwherein the ultimate dharma of surrendering oneself fully\nto K®ß√a is stated. Çrî K®ß√a tells Arjuna that giving up\neverything to follow His instructions need not be a cause\nof fear because K®ß√a will protect him. By such self-sur-\nrender Arjuna will come to K®ß√a in His Supreme Abode.\nThe Supreme Abode lies beyond the material universe\nand is known by those who are learned as Vaiku√†ha.\nThose who worship the Viß√u avatåras, or forms of\nNåråya√a, will attain to the Vaiku√†ha realm. But superior\nto Vaiku√†ha are the realms of K®ß√a’s avatåras such as Çrî\nRåmacandra in Ayodhyå and Våsudeva K®ß√a in Dvårakå.\nThose who worship Çrî Råmacandra and K®ß√a’s expan-\nsion as Våsudeva, will attain to Ayodhyå, Dvårakå and\nMathurå respectively.\nSuperior to Dvårakå is Mathurå. Superior to Mathurå\nis V®ndåvana. Govardhana is superior to V®ndåvana and\nRådhå-ku√∂a is superior to Govardhana. Only those who\nworship K®ß√a’s human-like form known as Çyåmasundara\n(Govinda) will attain to the topmost realm.\nvaiku√†håj janito varå madhu-purî tatråpi råsotsavåd\nv®ndåra√yam udåra-på√i-rama√åt tatråpi govardhana˙\nrådhå-ku√∂am ihåpi gokula-pate˙ premåm®tåplåvanåt\nkuryåd asya viråjato giri-ta†e sevåµ vivekî na ka˙\nBecause Çrî K®ß√a appeared there, Mathurå is consid-\nered to be spiritually superior to Vaiku√†ha. Greater\nthan Mathurå is the forest of V®ndåvana because\nthis was where the råsa-lîlå pastimes of K®ß√a took\nplace. Govardhana Hill is considered to be superior\nChapter 18\n445\nto V®ndåvana because K®ß√a performed wonder-\nful pastimes there and raised it with His left hand.\nHowever, Rådhå-ku√∂a is superior to Govardhana\nbecause it is brimming with the nectar of divine love\nfor the Master of Gokula. Which intelligent person\nwill not render service to this place that is situated at\nthe feet of Govardhana? (Upadeçåm®ta 9)\nThe Supreme Abode of K®ß√a is the land of Vraja,\nwhich includes V®ndåvana, Govardhana and Rådhå-ku√∂a.\nIn verse 66, Çrî K®ß√a indicates to Arjuna by the use of\nthe verb ‘vraja’ (meaning ‘to go’) that Arjuna will come\nto K®ß√a in the topmost realm of the spiritual world. This\nsuperior realm is also known as Goloka V®ndåvana and is\ndescribed in Brahma-saµhitå as follows:\ncintåma√i-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-v®kßa-\nlakßåv®teßu surabhîr abhipålayantam\nlakßmî-sahasra-çata-sambhrama-sevyamånaµ\ngovindam ådi-purußaµ tam ahaµ bhajåmi\nI worship Govinda, the Original Person, who is tend-\ning the cows, in that divine realm where the abodes\nare built with touchstone.
